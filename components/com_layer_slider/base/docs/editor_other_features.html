<h3>Deep-linking</h3>
<p>
  You have an option to deep-link slides. This means that
	you can give a special URL to users that will start LayerSlider with the desired
	slide. To do that, you have to specify a deeplink name in your Slide Options
	and use it as a reference in the URL.<br><br>

	For example if you added the name for the deeplink field "surprise", you can reference this slide with the URL "yourdomain.com/yourpage/#surprise".<br><br>
