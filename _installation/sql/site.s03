Odoo allows you to automatically post such an entry. You can transfer the new opening balance numerous times, because it is impossible to close a year at once. Correction entries will have to be made, due to which balances will change. The new balance can easily be transferred through a wizard, so you do not have to keep track of each correction entry made in the previous financial year. The procedure below is valid if you already have a financial year with entries in Odoo.</p>\r\n', '\r\n<h2><a name=\"new\">Steps to Open a New Financial Year</a></h2>\r\n<p>Before generating the opening balance for your various accounts, you have to go through several steps.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Create the new Financial Year: Create the new financial year as explained in <a href=\"#\">Defining a Period or a Financial Year</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Define an Opening Period:Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Periods &gt; Periods</code> and create a new period for the financial year you wish to open (in case it has not been generated automatically). Make sure to link the period to the newly defined financial year. Select the Opening/Closing Period checkbox to indicate that this period should be used for opening entries. Both dates typically match the first day of your financial year (e.g. 01/01/YYYY).</li>\r\n<li>Check the Account Types: Before generating the opening entries, make sure to check the defined account types, more specifically the <code>Deferral Method</code>. The deferral method determines whether and how account entries will be transferred to the new financial year. There are four possible deferral methods: None, Balance, Detail, Unreconciled.</li>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr><th class=\"text-nowrap\">Deferral Method</th><th>Action</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>None</td>\r\n<td>Nothing will be transferred (typically P&amp;L accounts)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Balance</td>\r\n<td>Account balance will be transferred (typically Balance Sheet accounts)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Detail</td>\r\n<td>All entries are transferred, also reconciled entries</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Unreconciled</td>\r\n<td>Only entries that are not reconciled on the first day of the new financial year will be transferred (typically receivable and payable)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n<li>Check the Link between Account and Account Type. Check whether each account is linked to the correct account type to avoid generating an incorrect opening entry.</li>\r\n<li>Create an Opening/Closing Journal. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals</code>. Create a new journal to post your opening entries. Make sure to respect the following settings:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Type should be <code>Opening/Closing Situation</code>.</li>\r\n<li>Standard debit/credit account could be something like <code>140000 Benefits</code>.</li>\r\n<li><code>Centralised</code> counterpart will be checked automatically when select the journal type, to avoid a counterpart on each line, and instead have one debit and one credit entry on the corresponding opening account.</li>\r\n<li>The <code>Entry Sequence</code> will also be created automatically on save.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Create a Purchase and/or Sales Journal for Outstanding Entries. We recommend you to create separate purchase and sales journals to post the outstanding entries from your previous accounting system. This will allow you to easily keep track of your opening entries. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals</code>. Create a new purchase and sales journal to post your outstanding entries. Make sure to respect the following settings:<br data-mce-bogus=\"1\" />\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Type should be Purchase or Sales.</li>\r\n<li>The Entry Sequence will also be created automatically on save.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Enter the Opening Balance (Miscellaneous Entry). For each account that needs to be reopened, enter account data (debit or credit) in the journal. For this operation, go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Journal Entries &gt; Journal Entries</code> and select a miscellaneous journal.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2><a name=\"opening\">Generating the Opening Entry</a></h2>\r\n<p>To automatically generate the opening entries based on your actual books, Odoo provides a wizard. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Periodical Processing &gt; End of Period &gt; Generate Opening Entries</code>.</p>\r\n<p>In the wizard, enter the financial year for which you want to transfer the balances (<code>Fiscal Year to close</code>). Select the <code>New Fiscal Year</code> (the year in which you want to generate the opening entry). You also have to select the journal and the period to post the opening entries. The description for the opening entry is proposed by default, but of course you can enter your own description, such as Opening Entry for financial year <code>YYYY</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/generate_opening_entries.png\" alt=\"generate opening entries\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Generating Opening Entries</code></em></p>\r\n<p>To have a look at the draft opening entry that has been generated, go to <code>Accounting &gt; Journal Entries &gt; Journal Entries</code>. And with the help of new filter Click on the <code>Unposted</code> to filter only draft entries. Open the corresponding entry and verify the data. Click the <code>Post</code> button to confirm the entry.</p>\r\n<p>As long as the audit is ongoing, extra entries may be added to the financial year to close. To automatically have the correct balances, Odoo allows you to use the Cancel Opening Entries wizard. This wizard will automatically cancel the existing opening entry.</p>\r\n<p>To update the balances to show the correct results, you should run the <code>Generate Opening Entries</code> wizard again. The new opening entry will contain the correct balances. This way, you can generate your opening entry as many times as required.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"closing\">Closing a Financial Year</a></h2>\r\n<p>To close a financial year, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Periodical Processing &gt; End of Period &gt; Cancel Closing Entries</code>. A wizard opens asking you for the financial year to close.</p>\r\n<p>When the year is closed, you can no longer create or modify any transactions in that year. So you should always make a backup of the database before closing the fiscal year. Closing a year is not mandatory, and you could easily do that sometime in the following year, when your accounts are finally sent to the statutory authorities, and no further modifications are permitted.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_fy_close.png\" alt=\"account fy close\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Closing a Financial Year</code></em></p>', '1', '27', '2015-08-14 04:33:32', '836', '', '2015-08-14 13:56:57', '836', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-08-14 04:33:32', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}', '3', '9', '', 'At the end of a financial year, you will have to transfer the closing balance of that year as an opening balance to the new financial year.

The wizard will propose to display entries for the current period only, but you can also leave the period empty to see a complete financial year. The structure of the chart is for calculating the VAT declaration, but all the other taxes can be calculated as well (such as the French DEEE).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_tax_chart.png\" alt=\"account tax chart\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Example of a Belgian VAT Structure</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The tax chart represents the amount of each area of the VAT declaration for your country. It is presented in a hierarchical structure which lets you see the detail only of what interests you and hides the less interesting subtotals. This structure can be altered as you wish to fit your needs.</p>\r\n<p>You can create several tax charts if your company is subject to different types of tax or tax-like accounts, such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Authors\' rights.</li>\r\n<li>Ecotaxes, such as the French DEEE for recycling electrical equipment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>By creating several charts of taxes, you can print different declarations from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Reporting &gt; Generic Reporting &gt; Taxes &gt; Taxes Report</code>.

This association is done automatically from the taxes which had previously been configured in the invoice lines.</p>\r\n<p>Some accounting software manages the tax declaration in a dedicated general account. The declaration is then limited to the balance in the specified period. In Odoo, you can create an independent chart of taxes, which has several advantages:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is possible to allocate only a part of the tax transaction.</li>\r\n<li>It is not necessary to manage several general accounts depending on the type of sales and the type of tax.</li>\r\n<li>You can restructure your chart of taxes as required.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>At any time, you can check your chart of taxes for a given period using the report.</p>\r\n<p>Data is updated in real time. This is very useful because it enables you to preview at any time the tax that you owe at the start and end of the month or quarter.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, for your tax declaration, you can click one of the tax accounts to investigate the detailed entries that make up the full amount. This helps you search for errors, such as when you have entered an invoice at full tax rate when it should have been zero-rated for an intracommunity trade or for charity.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"indicator\">Management Indicators</a></h2>\r\n<p>With Odoo you can also create your own financial reports. This feature is now included in standard Odoo. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Financial Reports &gt; Account Reports</code> and click Create.</p>\r\n<p>Suppose we would like to create our company Balance Sheet. The first report to be created, should be a View report which will contain the final details. Keep the default Sequence 0.</p>\r\n<p>Now create the <code>Assets</code> report, and set <code>Balance Sheet</code> as the parent for this report. Set the Sequence to 1.</p>\r\n<p>Now create the <code>Liabilities</code> report, and set <code>Balance Sheet</code> as the parent for this report too. Set the Sequence to 2.</p>\r\n<p>Both these reports are of the View type.</p>\r\n<p>Apart from the View type, you can select three other types: Accounts, Account Type and Report Value.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Accounts</code>: here you can select view accounts or individual accounts that should be included in the report. View accounts offer the advantage that when new accounts are added as a child of such view account, they will automatically be printed on the report. When selecting individual accounts, you need to specifically add each newly created account to get the correct report.</li>\r\n<li><code>Account Type</code>: selecting an account type means that all accounts related to the selected account type(s) will be printed on the report.</li>\r\n<li><code>Report Value</code>: thanks to this value you can include the balance of existing reports in another report. Example: create a profit &amp; loss report (view) including costs (account class 6) and income (account class 7). In the Balance Sheet, define a report <code>Profit&amp;Loss Balance</code>, with Balance Sheet as the Parent. Set the type to Report Value and link it to the P&amp;L view report you defined. This way, the balance sheet will print the Profit&amp;Loss result.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/financial_reports.png\" alt=\"financial reports\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Financial Reports</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Create a report to print the Asset accounts (class 2 from the Belgian ledger) on the Assets side of the report. As a Parent, define the Assets report; sequence 3, type Accounts. If you want to use all accounts of class 2, just select the class (view account). You can also select various asset accounts. You could also have set this report to Account Type, with type Immo.</p>\r\n<p>If you just want the sum of the selected accounts to appear, you leave the settings as they are. Should you wish to print the account details as well, you can select the Display details checkbox. The report will then also print the selected account numbers.</p>\r\n<p>To print the results, go to <code>Accounting &gt; Reporting &gt; Legal Reports &gt; Accounting Reports &gt; Financial Report</code>. Select the report you want to print (only reports of the <code>View</code> type will be displayed in the list). You can also print a report for specific periods or dates. If you select the Enable Comparison checkbox, an extra Comparison tab will appear in which you can, for instance, select periods from a previous financial year. You have to give the comparison column a name through the Column Label field.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_fin_report.png\" alt=\"account fin report\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Example of a Financial Report</code></em></p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"budgeting\">Good Management Budgeting</a></h2>\r\n<p>Budgets are important for a company to get a good grip on forecasted expenses and revenues. They allow you to measure your actual financial performance against the planned one.</p>\r\n<p>Odoo manages its budgets using both <code>General</code> and <code>Analytic Accounts</code>. Go to <code>Settings &gt; Modules &gt; Local Modules</code> and install <code>account_budget</code> to be able to do this, or you can go to <code>Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounting</code> and select option <code>Budget management</code> and click on Apply button , it will install this module.</p>\r\n<p>The first step in defining budgets is to determine the general accounts for which you want to keep budgets (typically expense or income accounts). That is what you will use Budgetary Positions for, from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Budgets &gt; Budgetary Positions</code>. Here you can select the general accounts for which you want to keep budgets. The aim is to group general accounts logically, according to sales or purchases, for instance. Odoo has no limitations as to the account types that can be used for budgeting.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_budget_pos.png\" alt=\"account budget pos\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Budgetary Position for Sales</code></em></p>\r\n<p>To define your budgets, go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Budgets &gt; Budgets</code>. Define a new budget by clicking the Create button.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_budget_form.png\" alt=\"account budget form\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Optimistic Budget</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Even though you can modify a budget at any time to make a revision, we recommend you to create a new budget, because otherwise you will have no history of changes.</p>\r\n<p>Rather than edit an existing budget, make a new version so that you can keep your original estimates safe for comparison. This lets you analyse your changing perspectives of the company from revision to revision.</p>\r\n<p>To define your budgets, start by entering a <code>Name</code>, a <code>Code</code>, a <code>Duration</code> for your new budget. Then you can define the budgeted amounts for each analytic account within a specified period, one by one (enter negative amounts for purchases, positive amounts for sales). For each, you define:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>An <code>Analytic Account</code>.</li>\r\n<li>A <code>Budgetary Position</code>, for example Sales or Purchases.</li>\r\n<li>A <code>Duration</code> for the budget.</li>\r\n<li>A <code>Planned Amount</code> in the default currency of the chart of accounts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once this information is completed, save your budget.</p>\r\n<p>A budget has various stages:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Confirmed</code>: the budget is to be reviewed, but it can still be changed before actual approval.</li>\r\n<li><code>Approved</code>: the budget is approved by the budget holder; the name of the user approving the budget will be displayed in the Validate User field.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can cancel a budget and reset it to draft for the two preceding steps.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Done</code>: the budget is fully approved and no changes will be allowed. You can no longer cancel the budget and reset it to draft.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The <code>Theoretical Amount</code> indicates the actual amount that might have been realised for the budget concerned according to the current date. When your budget is 1200 for 12 months, and today is the 30 October, the theoretical amount will be 1000, since this is the actual amount that could have been realised to date.</p>\r\n<p>To print a budget and make calculations of expenditure through budget, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Budgets &gt; Budgets</code>. Odoo then gives you a list of available budgets. Select one or more budgets and then click <code>Print Budgets</code> to create the report for each, in a date range of your choice.</p>\r\n<p>The <code>Print Budget</code> report gives an overview of each analytic account included in your budget, according to the individual budgetary positions for that account. From the percentage and the comparison of planned (budgeted) and practical (actual) amounts, you have a good view on your situation.</p>\r\n<p>From the same list of actions, you can also print the <code>Print Summary</code> report, which will give you a total per analytic account (without splitting by budgetary position).</p>\r\n<p>Each of these reports can be printed from a specific date to a specific date. The <code>End Date</code> selected in the wizard determines how the theoretical amount will be calculated; if you select the last day of your financial year, the theoretical amount will be calculated as a function of that date (thus considering a complete financial year). Note that the theoretical amount will be zero when the <code>Paid Date</code> entered is equal to or greater than the <code>End Date</code> for the budget.</p>\r\n<p>The percentage for a budget is calculated as follows: (practical amount / theoretical amount) x 100. This way you get a view on how much of the forecasted amount has been actually realised in your accounting.</p>\r\n<p>The figure <code>Printing a Budget</code> gives an example of a budget produced by Odoo.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_budget.png\" alt=\"account budget\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Printing a Budget</code></em></p>\r\n<p>You can Print the Summarised Budget from selecting <code>Print Summary</code> option in Print button Option.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_budget_summ.png\" alt=\"account budget summ\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Summarised Budget</code></em></p>\r\n<p>You could also use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Reporting &gt; Generic Reporting &gt; Budgets &gt; Budget Lines</code>.

They are automatically generated by the following operations:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Confirmation of an invoice generates analytic entries for sales or purchases connected to the account shown in the invoice line.</li>\r\n<li>The entry of a service generates an analytic entry for the cost of this service to the given project.</li>\r\n<li>The manufacturing of a product generates an entry for the manufacturing cost of each operation in the product range.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other documents linked to one of these three operations produce analytic records indirectly. For example, when you are entering a customer sales order, you can link it to the customer\'s analytic account. When you are managing by case or project, mark the project with that order. This order will then generate a customer invoice, which will be linked to the analytic account. When the invoice is validated, it will automatically create general and analytic accounting records for the corresponding project.</p>\r\n<p>Expense receipts from an employee can be linked to an analytic account for reimbursement. When a receipt is approved by the company, a purchase invoice is created. This invoice represents a debit on the company in favour of the employee. Each line of the purchase invoice is then linked to an analytic account which automatically allocates the costs for that receipt to the corresponding project.</p>\r\n<p>To visualise the general entries following these different actions, you can use one of the following menus:</p>\r\n<blockquote><ol>\r\n<li>To see all of the entries, <code>Accounting &gt; Journal Entries &gt; Analytic Journal Items/code&gt;.</code></li>\r\n<li>To see the entries per account, per user, per product or per partner, you can use the menu <code>Reporting &gt; Accounting &gt; Analytic Entries Analysis</code>.</li>\r\n</ol></blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_analytic_analysis2.png\" alt=\"account analytic analysis2\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Analytic Entries Analysis</code></em></p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"modes\">Analytic Models</a></h2>\r\n<p>Standard Odoo allows you to post analytic entries to one chart at a time.

But because of all the information they pull together, Odoo\'s analytic accounts can be a useful management tool, at the center of most system processes.</p>\r\n<p>There are several reasons for this:</p>\r\n<p>They reflect your entire management activity.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Unlike the general accounts, the structure of the analytic accounts is not regulated by legal obligations, so each company can adapt it to its needs.</li>\r\n<li>In some software packages, analytic accounts are managed as an extension of general accounts – for example, by using the two last digits of the account code to represent analytic accounts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In Odoo, analytic accounts are linked to general accounts but are treated totally independently. So you can enter various different analytic operations that have no counterpart in the general financial accounts.</p>\r\n<p>While the structure of the general chart of accounts is imposed by law, the analytic chart of accounts is built to fit a company\'s needs closely.</p>\r\n<p>Just as in the general accounts, you will find accounting entries in the different analytic accounts. Each analytic entry can be linked to a general account, or not, as you wish. Conversely, an entry in a general account can be linked to one, several, or no corresponding analytic accounts.</p>\r\n<p>You will discover many advantages of this independent representation below. For the more impatient, here are some of those advantages:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can manage many different analytic operations.</li>\r\n<li>You can modify an analytic plan on the fly, during the course of an activity, because of its independence.</li>\r\n<li>You can avoid an explosion in the number of general accounts.</li>\r\n<li>Even those companies that do not use Odoo\'s general accounts can use the analytic accounts for management.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Unlike general accounts, analytic accounts in Odoo are not so much an accounting tool for Accounts as a management tool for everyone in the company. (That is why they are also called management accounts.)</p>\r\n<p>The main users of analytic accounts should be the directors, general managers and project managers. Analytic accounts make up a powerful tool that can be used in different ways. The trick is to create your own analytic structure for a chart of accounts that closely matches your company\'s needs.</p>\r\n<p>To illustrate analytic accounts clearly, you will follow three use cases, each in one of three different types of company:</p>\r\n<blockquote><ol>\r\n<li>Industrial Manufacturing Enterprise.</li>\r\n<li>Law Firm.</li>\r\n<li>IT Services Company.</li>\r\n</ol></blockquote>\r\n<h2><a name=\"case1\">Case 1: Industrial Manufacturing Enterprise</a></h2>\r\n<p>In industry, you will often find analytic charts of accounts structured into departments and products the company itself is built on.</p>\r\n<p>So the objective is to examine the costs, sales and margins by department and by product. The first level of the structure comprises the different departments, and the lower levels represent the product ranges the company makes and sells.</p>\r\n<p>Analytic Chart of Accounts for an Industrial Manufacturing Company</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Marketing Department.</li>\r\n<li>Commercial Department.</li>\r\n<li>Administration Department.</li>\r\n<li>Production.\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Product Range 1</li>\r\n<li>Sub-groups</li>\r\n<li>Product Range 2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In daily use, it is useful to mark the analytic account on each purchase invoice. The analytic account is the one to which the costs of that purchase should be allocated. When the invoice is approved, it will automatically generate the entries for both the general and the corresponding analytic accounts. So, for each entry on the general accounts, there is at least one analytic entry that allocates costs to the department which incurred them.</p>\r\n<p>Here is a possible breakdown of some general accounting entries for the example above, allocated to various analytic accounts:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Breakdown of general and analytic accounting entries

All of the expenses and products are then attached to a given file.</p>\r\n<p>A principal preoccupation of law firms is the invoicing of hours worked, and the profitability by case and by employee.</p>\r\n<p>Mechanisms used for encoding the hours worked will be covered in detail in Human Resources. Like most system processes, hours worked are integrated into the analytic accounting. Every time an employee enters a timesheet for a number of hours, that automatically generates analytic accounts corresponding to the cost of those hours in the case concerned. The hourly charge is a function of the employee\'s salary.</p>\r\n<p>So a law firm will opt for an analytic representation which reflects the management of the time that employees work on the different client cases.</p>\r\n<p><code>Example Representation of an Analytic Chart of Accounts for a Law Firm</code></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Absences\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Paid Absences</li>\r\n<li>Unpaid Absences</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Internal Projects\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Administrative</li>\r\n<li>Others</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Client Cases\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Client 1\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Case 1.1</li>\r\n<li>Case 1.2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Client 2\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Client 2.1</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>All expenses and sales are then attached to a case. This gives the profitability of each case and, at a consolidated level, of each client.</p>\r\n<p>Billing for the different cases is a bit unusual. The cases do not match any entry in the general account nor do they come from purchase or sales invoices.

In this example, the cost of Case 1.1 is 95.00 (the sum of the analytic costs of studying the files, searching for information and fuel costs), but has been invoiced at 280.00, which gives you a gross profit of 185.00.</p>\r\n<p>But an interest in analytical accounts is not limited to a simple analysis of the profitability of different cases.</p>\r\n<p>The same data can be used for automatic recharging of the services to the client at the end of the month. To invoice clients, just take the analytic costs in that month and apply a selling price factor to generate the invoice. Invoicing mechanisms for this are explained in greater detail in Services &amp; Project Management. If the client requires details of the services used on the case, you can print the service entries in the analytic account for this case.</p>\r\n<p>Most software that manages billing enables you to recharge hours worked. In Odoo, these services are automatically represented by analytic costs. But many other Odoo documents can also generate analytic costs, such as credit notes and purchases of goods.</p>\r\n<p>So when you invoice the client at the end of the month, it is possible for you to include all the analytic costs, and not just the hours worked. So, for example, you can easily recharge the whole cost of your journeys to the client.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"case3\">Case 3: IT Services Company</a></h2>\r\n<p>Most IT service companies face the following problems:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Project planning.</li>\r\n<li>Invoicing, profitability and financial follow-up of projects.</li>\r\n<li>Managing support contracts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To deal with these problems, you would use an analytic chart of accounts structured by project and by contract. A representation of that is given in the following example:</p>\r\n<p><code>Example Analytic Representation of a Chart of Accounts for an IT Services Company</code></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Internal Projects\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Administrative and Commercial.</li>\r\n<li>Research and Development.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Client Projects\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Client 1\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Project 1.1</li>\r\n<li>Project 1.2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Client 2\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Project 2.1</li>\r\n<li>Project 2.2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Support Contracts – 20h\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Customer X</li>\r\n<li>Customer Y</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The management of services, expenditures and sales is similar to that presented above for lawyers. Invoicing and the study of profitability are also similar.</p>\r\n<p>But now look at support contracts. These contracts are usually limited to a prepaid number of hours. Each service posted in the analytic accounts shows the remaining hours of support. To manage support contracts, you would use the quantities and not the amounts in the analytic entries.</p>\r\n<p>In Odoo, each analytic line lists the number of units sold or used, as well as what you would usually find there – the amount in currency units (USD or GBP, or whatever other choice you make). So you can sum the quantities sold and used on each analytic account to determine whether any hours of the support contract remain.</p>\r\n<p>To differentiate services from other costs in the analytic account, you use the concept of the analytic journal. Analytic entries are then allocated into the different journals:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Service journal.</li>\r\n<li>Expense journal.</li>\r\n<li>Sales journal.</li>\r\n<li>Purchase journal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To obtain the detailed breakdown of a support contract, you only have to look at the service journal for the analytic account corresponding to the contract in question.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the analytic account can be used to forecast future needs. For example, monthly planning of staff on different projects can be seen as an analytic budget limited to the service journal. Accounting entries are expressed in quantities (such as number of hours, and numbers of products), and in amounts in units of currency (USD or GBP for instance).</p>\r\n<p>So you can set up planning on just the basis of quantities. Analysing the analytic budget enables you to compare the budget (that is, your plan) to the services actually carried out by month end.</p>\r\n<p>Problems of cash management are amongst the main difficulties encountered by small growing businesses. It is really difficult to predict the amount of cash that will be available when a company is young and rapidly growing.</p>\r\n<p>If the company adopts management by case, then staff planning can be represented in the analytic accounts report, as you have seen.</p>\r\n<p>But since you know your selling price for each of the different projects, you can see that it is easy to use the plan in the analytic accounts to more precisely forecast the amounts that you will invoice in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>', '1', '27', '2015-08-14 13:56:48', '836', '', '2015-08-14 14:09:35', '836', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-08-14 13:56:48', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}', '2', '10', '', 'Sitting at the heart of your company\'s processes, analytic accounts (or cost accounts) are indispensable tools for managing your operations well.

At the end of the day, each employee must mark all the time worked on client or internal projects to make up the full number of hours worked in the day. If an account is not in the system, then the time is added to the hours that have not been assigned for the day.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/service_timesheet_list.png\" alt=\"service timesheet list\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Timesheet for a working day</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The figure <code>Timesheet for a working day</code> gives an example of a timesheet for an employee.</p>\r\n<p>Do not confuse timesheets and attendance compliance</p>\r\n<p>The timesheet system is not intended to be a disguised attendance form. There is no control over the service times and the employee is free to encode 8 or 9 hours or more of services each day if they want.</p>\r\n<p>If you decide to put such a system into place, it is important to clarify this point with your staff. The objective here is not to control hours, because the employees decide for themselves what they will be entering – but to track the tasks running and the allocation of costs between them is the responsibility of the management.</p>\r\n<p>To enable your system with all the features related to Timesheet, you need to install Timesheet module from module list or Go to menu <code>Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Human Resources tick <code>Manage timesheets</code> and click on apply button.</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/config_wiz_timesheets.png\" alt=\"config wiz timesheets\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Install Timesheet Module</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Amongst the many uses of such a timesheet system for a company, here are some of the most important:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>enabling tracking of the true costs of a project by accounting for the time used on it,</li>\r\n<li>tracking the services provided by different employees,</li>\r\n<li>comparing the hours really used on a project with the initial planning estimates,</li>\r\n<li>automatically invoicing based on the service hours provided,</li>\r\n<li>obtaining a list of the service hours for a given client,</li>\r\n<li>knowing the costs needed to run the company, such as the marketing costs, the training costs for a new employee, and the invoicing rates for a client.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Timesheet Categories</h3>\r\n<p>You will need to install the <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33:manufaturing&amp;catid=20:odoo-modules&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;Itemid=230\" target=\"_blank\">Manufacturing</a> application (<code>mrp</code>) in order to access timesheet categories. The different timesheet categories (working time sessions) can be defined through the menu <code>Manufacturing &gt; Configuration &gt; Resources &gt; Working Time</code> and selecting one of the groups there such as <code>45 Hours/Week</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/service_timesheet_def.png\" alt=\"service timesheet def\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Timesheet category for full time 45 hours per week</code></em></p>\r\n<p>To be able to use timesheets fully, install the module <code>hr_timesheet_sheet</code> from module list or Go to menu <code>Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Human Resources</code> tick <code>Allow timesheets validation by managers</code> and click on apply button.. Once this module has been installed and the employees configured, the different system users can enter their timesheet data in the menu <code>Human Resources &gt; Time Tracking &gt; Timesheet Activities</code>, then click Create.</p>\r\n<p>It is a good idea if all employees who use timesheets place this menu in their shortcuts. That is because they will need to return to them several times each day.</p>\r\n<p>For a new entry:</p>\r\n<blockquote><ol>\r\n<li>The <code>User</code>: proposed by default, but you can change it if you are encoding the first timesheet for another company employee.</li>\r\n<li>The <code>Date</code>: automatically proposed as today\'s date, but it is possible to change it if you are encoding the timesheet for a prior day.</li>\r\n<li><code>Analytic Account</code>: for the project you have been working on - obviously it should be predefined.</li>\r\n<li><code>Description</code>: a free text description of the work done in the time.</li>\r\n<li><code>Duration</code>: number of units of time (the units are defined as part of the product).</li>\r\n</ol></blockquote>\r\n<p>The other fields are automatically completed, but can be modified: the Product which is the service product such as consultancy, the <code>Unit of Measure</code> (predefined, and could perhaps be minutes, hours or days), the <code>Cost</code> of the service (which is calculated by default), and the associated <code>General Account</code>.</p>\r\n<p>The hours are then encoded throughout the day by each employee. It helps to revisit the list at the end of the day to verify that the number of hours of attendance in the company has been properly accounted for. The total entered is shown at the bottom right of the list of service hours.</p>\r\n<p>By default, Odoo is configured to show the amount of each service when an employee encodes the number of hours per project. You can modify this field by adding the attribute <code>invisible=True</code> in the timesheet view.</p>\r\n<p>(And the way to do that is either to modify the view on the file system, or click on the logged in user at top-right and select <code>About Odoo</code> and then select <code>Activate the developer mode</code>. Now go to the <code>HR &gt; Time Tracking &gt; Timesheet Activities</code> menu. Click on <code>Debug View#</code> and then select Edit TreeView.</p>\r\n<p>If you have sufficient permissions, you can edit the XML that defines the current view.)</p>\r\n<p>The value in the <code>Amount</code> field shows employees the cost of their time used in the company, so masking this field might not always be the best option.</p>\r\n<p>The accuracy of the services entered is crucial for calculating the profitability of the different jobs and the recharging of services. Different reports are therefore available for verifying employees\' data entry. Employees can verify their own timesheet using the following reports:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Printing the particular employee\'s timesheet, using the menu <code>Reporting &gt; Human Resources &gt; Employee Timesheet</code>.</li>\r\n<li>Printing more than one employees\' timesheet, using the menu <code>Reporting &gt; Human Resources &gt; Reports &gt; Employees Timesheet</code>. You can print a summary in the form of a table per user and per day.</li>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/service_timesheet_all.png\" alt=\"service timesheet all\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Employees\' monthly summary timesheet</code></em></p>\r\n<li>Reviewing profit of timesheet, using the menu <code>Reporting &gt; Human Resources &gt; Reports &gt; Timesheet Profit</code>.</li>\r\n<li>You can then use the statistical reports to analyze your services by period, by product or by account using the menu <code>Reporting &gt; Human Resources &gt; Timesheet Analysis and Reporting &gt; Human Resources &gt; Timesheet Sheet Analysis</code>.</li>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/service_timesheet_graph.png\" alt=\"service timesheet graph\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Chart of timesheet by account</code></em></p>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You already know that timesheets are closely linked with analytic accounts. The different projects reported on the timesheets correspond to analytic accounts. The timesheet entries themselves are analytic entries.</p>\r\n<p>These entries comprise various analytic operations that do not correspond to any of the general accounts. Therefore all operations that modify and create timesheet lines automatically impact the corresponding analytic line and, conversely are automatically modified by changes in that line.</p>\r\n<h3>Timesheets and Analytical Data</h3>\r\n<p>The implementation of timesheets in Odoo relating to analytic entries is managed by an inheritance mechanism: the timesheet object inherits the analytic entry object.</p>\r\n<p>The information is therefore not encoded into the database as two separate events, which avoids many synchronization problems. They are stored in two different tables, however, because a service is an analytical entry, but an analytical entry is not necessarily a service.</p>\r\n<p>This is not a classical approach, but it is logical and pragmatic. Employee timesheets are a good indication of how the costs of a service enterprise are spread across different cases, as reported in the analytic accounts.</p>\r\n<p>An analytic account should be reflected in the general accounts, but there is no direct counterpart of these analytic accounts in the general accounts. Instead, if the hourly costs of the employees are correctly accounted for, the month\'s timesheet entries should be balanced by the salary + benefits package paid out to all the employees at the end of the month.</p>\r\n<p>Despite all this, it is quite difficult to work out the average hourly cost of an employee precisely, because it depends on:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the extra hours that they have worked,</li>\r\n<li>holidays and sickness,</li>\r\n<li>salary variations and all the linked costs, such as social insurance charges.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The reports that enable you to relate general accounts to analytic accounts are valuable tools for improving your evaluation of different hourly costs of employees. The difference between product balances in the analytic account and in the general accounts, divided by the total number of hours worked, can then be applied to the cost of the product. Some companies adjust for that difference by carrying out another analytic operation at the end of the month in an account created for that purpose. This analytic account should have a balance that tends towards zero.</p>\r\n<p>Because you have got a system with integrated timesheets, you can then:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>track the profitability of projects in the analytic accounts,</li>\r\n<li>look at the history of timesheet entries by project and by employee,</li>\r\n<li>regularly adjust hourly costs by comparing your rates with reality,</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Project Cost Control</h3>\r\n<p>Controlling the costs and the profitability of projects precisely is very important.</p>\r\n<p>It enables you to make good estimates and to track budgets allocated to different services and their projects, such as sales and, R&amp;D costs. You can also refine your arguments on the basis of clear facts rather than guesses if you have to renegotiate a contract with a customer following a project slippage.</p>\r\n<p>The analyses of profitability by project and by employee are available from the analytic accounts. They take all of the invoices into account, and also take into account the cost of the time spent on each project.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"inout\">Manage attendance through Sign in / Sign out</a></h2>\r\n<p>In some companies, staff have to sign in when they arrive at work and sign out again at the end of the day. If each employee has been linked to a system user, then they can sign in on Odoo by using the menu <code>Human Resources &gt; Attendances &gt; Sign in / Sign out</code>.</p>\r\n<p>If an employee has forgotten to sign out on leaving, the system proposes that they sign out manually and type in the time that they left when they come in again the next day. This gives you a simple way of managing forgotten sign-outs.</p>\r\n<p>Find employee attendance details from their forms in <code>Human Resources &gt; Employees &gt; Employees</code>.</p>\r\n<p>To get the detail of attendance from an employee\'s form in Odoo, you can use the available reports:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Attendances By Month</li>\r\n<li>Attendances By Week</li>\r\n<li>Attendance Error Report</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The last report highlights errors in attendance data entry. It shows you whether an employee has entered the time of entry or exit manually and the differences between the actual and expected sign out time and the time.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"keeptrack\">Keep track of differences between timesheets and attendance</a></h2>\r\n<p>When they are used properly, timesheets can be a good control tool for project managers and can provide awareness of costs and times.</p>\r\n<p>When employee teams are important, a control system must be implemented. All employees should complete their timesheets correctly because this forms the basis of planning control, and the financial management and invoicing of projects</p>\r\n<p>You will see in <code>Deliver Quality Services</code> that you can automatically invoice services at the end of the month based on the timesheet. But at the same time, some contracts are limited to prepaid hours. These hours and their deduction from the original limit are also managed by these timesheets.</p>\r\n<p>In such a situation, hours that are not coded into the timesheets represent lost money for the company. So it is important to establish effective follow-up of the services timesheets and their encoding. To set up a structure for control using timesheets you should install the module <code>hr_timesheet_sheet</code> (Timesheets in the Reconfigure wizard).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/timesheet_flow.png\" alt=\"timesheet flow\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Process of approving a timesheet</code></em></p>\r\n<p>This module supplies a new screen enabling you to manage timesheets by period. Timesheet entries are made by employees each day. At the end of the week, employees validate their week\'s sheet and it is then passed to the services manager, who must approve his team\'s entries. Periods are defined in the company forms, and you can set them to run monthly or weekly.</p>\r\n<p>To enter timesheet data each employee uses the menu <code>Human Resources &gt; Time Tracking &gt; My Current Timesheet</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/service_timesheet_sheet_form.png\" alt=\"service timesheet sheet form\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Form for entering timesheet data</code></em></p>\r\n<p>This form describes summary of attendance (total hours) of employee.</p>\r\n<p>The second tab of the timesheet, <code>Details</code>, gives the number of hours worked on the different projects.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/timesheet_sheet_hours.png\" alt=\"timesheet sheet hours\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Detail of hours worked on different projects for an employee</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The third tab of timesheet, <code>Attendances</code>, shows when there is a gap between the attendance and the timesheet entries, you can use the third tab to detect the days or the entries that have not been correctly entered.</p>\r\n<p>The user starts with the sign-in and sign-out times. The system enables the control of attendance day by day. The two buttons <code>Sign In</code> and <code>Sign Out</code> enable the automatic completion of hours in the area to the right. These hours can be modified by employee, so it is not a true management control system.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/attendances_new.png\" alt=\"attendances new\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Detail of hours worked by day for an employee</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The button <code>Timesheet Activities</code> shows the time worked on all the different projects. That enables you to step back to see an overview of the time an employee has worked spread over different projects.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of the week or the month, the employee can submit his/her timesheet to manager by clicking on button <code>Submit to Manager</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Each manager can then look at a list of his department\'s timesheets waiting for approval using the menu Reporting &gt; Human Resource &gt; Timesheet Sheet Analysis by applying the proper filters. He then has to approve them or return them to their initial state.</p>\r\n<p>To define the departmental structure, use the menu <code>Human Resources &gt; Configuration &gt; Human Resources &gt; Departments</code>.</p>\r\n<h3>Timesheet Approval</h3>\r\n<p>At first sight, the approval of timesheets by a department manager can seem a bureaucratic hindrance. This operation is crucial for effective management, however. We have too frequently seen companies in the situation where managers are so overworked that they do not know what their employees are doing.</p>\r\n<p>So this approval process supplies the manager with an outline of each employee\'s work at least once a week. And this is carried out for the hours worked on all the different projects.</p>\r\n<p>Once the timesheets have been approved, you can then use them for cost control and for invoicing hours to clients.</p>\r\n<p>Contracts and their rates, planning, and methods of invoicing are the object of the following chapter, <code>Deliver Quality Services</code>.</p>', '1', '28', '2015-08-15 02:59:37', '836', '', '2015-08-15 03:38:36', '836', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-08-15 02:59:37', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}', '2', '5', '', 'In most service companies where Odoo has been integrated, service sheets, or timesheets, have revolutionized management practices.

The expense sheet must be signed by the employee, who also attaches its receipts to the expense sheet.</p>\r\n<p>Once the sheet has been approved by the head of department, it is sent to the Accounting department, which registers the company\'s liability to the employee. Accounting can then pay this invoice and reimburse the employee who originally advanced the money.</p>\r\n<p>Some receipts are for project expenses, so these can then be attached to an analytic account. The costs incurred are then added to the supplementary cost of the analytic account when the invoice is approved.</p>\r\n<p>You often need to invoice expenses to a customer, depending on the precise contract that has been negotiated. Travelling and subsistence expenses are generally handled this way. These can be charged to the customer at the end of the month if the contract price has been negotiated inclusive of expenses.</p>\r\n<p>If you have to go through many steps to reclaim expenses, it can all quickly become too cumbersome, especially for those employees who claim large numbers of different expense lines.

They are usually identified by bar codes stuck on the products. The batch can be marked with a supplier number or your own company numbers.</li>\r\n<li>Tracking numbers are logistical lots to identify the container for a set of products. This corresponds, for example, to the pallet numbers on which several different products are stocked.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These lots can be encoded onto all stock moves and, specifically, on incoming shipments lines, internal moves and outgoing deliveries.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/picking_form_line.png\" alt=\"picking form line\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Entering a Line for Production Receipt</code></em></p>\r\n<p>To enter the Serial number in an operation, you can use an existing Serial number or create a new pack. A Serial (batch number) is used for a single product. A tracking number can be used several times for different products, so you can mix different products on a pallet or in a box.</p>\r\n<p>You can also specify on the product form the operations in which a Serial number is required. You can then compel the user to set a lot number for manufacturing operations, goods receipt, or customer packing.</p>\r\n<p>You do not have to encode the Serial numbers one by one to assign a unique Serial number to a set of several items. You only need to take a stock move for several products line and click the button Split in Serial Number. You can then give a Serial number prefix (if you want) and Odoo will complete the prefix in the wizard with a continuing sequence number.

Everything in the journal can be invoiced in one go, and you can control the amounts by journal. For example, you can create the following journals: daily invoicing, end-of-week invoicing and monthly invoicing. It is also possible to show the invoicing journal by default in the partner form. Set the Invoicing Method to Grouped (one invoice per customer) or Non Grouped (individual invoices) according to your needs.</p>\r\n<p>Stock journals (<code>Warehouse &gt; Configuration &gt; Warehouse Management &gt; Stock Journals</code>) allow you to classify the delivery orders in various ways, such as by department, by salesperson or by type. If a salesperson looks for a delivery order in his own journal, he can easily see the work on current items compared with his own orders.</p>\r\n<p>To enter all the orders in his own stock journal, a salesperson can use the default values that are entered in the fields when creating orders.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the stock journals can also be used as delivery journals to post each item into a delivery journal. For example, you can create journals dated according to customer delivery dates (such as Monday\'s deliveries, or afternoon deliveries) or these journals could represent the day\'s work for delivery vehicles (such as truck1, truck2).</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"usejournal\">Using the Journals</a></h2>\r\n<p>You will now see how to use the journals to organize your stock management in practice.

You then assign a type: <code>Material</code> or <code>Human</code>, a code and the operating hours, i.e. Working Period. The Working Time(s) can be defined through the menu <code>Manufacturing &gt; Configuration &gt; Resources &gt; Working Time</code>. The figure <code>Defining a Work Center</code> represents the hours from Monday to Friday, from 08:00 to 18:00 with a break of an hour from 12:00.</p>\r\n<p>You can also add a description of the work center and its operations.</p>\r\n<p>Once the work center is defined, you should enter data about its production capacity. Depending on whether you have a machine or a person, a work center will be defined in cycles or hours. If it represents a set of machines and people you can use cycles and hours at the same time.</p>\r\n<p>A cycle corresponds to the time required to carry out an assembly operation. The user is free to determine which is the reference operation for a given work center. It should be represented by the cost and elapsed manufacturing time.</p>\r\n<p>For example, for a printing work center, a cycle might be the printing of 1 page or of 1000 pages depending on the printer.</p>\r\n<p>To define the capacity properly, it is necessary to know, for each work center, what will be the reference operation which determines the cycle. You can then define the data relative to the capacity.</p>\r\n<p><code>Capacity per Cycle (CA)</code>: the number of operations that can be done in parallel during a cycle. Generally, the number defines the number of identical machines or people defined by the work center.</p>\r\n<p><code>Time for 1 cycle (hour) (TC)</code>: the duration in hours for one cycle or the operations defined by a cycle.</p>\r\n<p><code>Time before production (TS)</code>: the time in hours required to initialize production operations. Generally, this represents the machine setup time.</p>\r\n<p><code>Time after production (TN)</code>: the delay in hours after the end of a production operation. Generally, this represents the cleaning time necessary after an operation.</p>\r\n<p><code>Efficiency factor (ET)</code>: the factor that is applied to the TC, TS and TN times to determine the real production time. This factor enables you to readjust the different times progressively and as a measure of machine utilization. You cannot re-adjust the other times, because generally they are taken from the machine\'s data sheet. By default, the efficiency is set to 1, representing a load of 100%. When you set the efficiency to 2 (i.e. 200%), the load will be 50%.</p>\r\n<p>The total time for carrying out X operations is then given by the following formula:</p>\r\n<p><code>((X / CA) * TC + TS + TN ) * ET</code></p>\r\n<p>In this formula the result of the division is rounded upwards. Then, if the capacity per cycle is 6, it takes 3 cycles to realize 15 operations (15/6 = 2.5, rounded upwards = 3).</p>\r\n<p>If you leave the different fields empty, it will not have any effect on the analytic accounts.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"routing\">Routings</a></h2>\r\n<p>Routings define the manufacturing operations to be done in work centers to produce a certain product. A routing is usually attached to bills of materials, which will define the assembly of products required for manufacturing or to produce finished products.</p>\r\n<p>A routing can be defined directly in a bill of materials or through the menu <code>Manufacturing &gt; Products &gt; Routings</code>. A routing has a name, and a code. You can also add a description. Later in this chapter you will see that a routing can also be associated with a stock location.

You can use this functionality when you have subcontracted the assembly of a product to a supplier, for instance.</p>\r\n<p>In the routing, you have to enter the list of operations that has to be executed. Each operation has to be done at a specific work center and includes a number of hours and/or cycles.</p>\r\n<p>It is possible to define routing on several levels to support multi-level bills of materials.

To do this, use the <code>menu Warehouse &gt; Schedulers &gt; Run Schedulers</code>.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"workflow\">Complete Production Workflow</a></h2>\r\n<p>To understand the usefulness and the functioning of the system you should test a complete workflow on the Odoo demo. We will show you:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How to create a sales order,</li>\r\n<li>The manufacturing workflow for an intermediate product,</li>\r\n<li>The manufacturing of an ordered product,</li>\r\n<li>The delivery of products to a customer,</li>\r\n<li>Invoicing at the end of the month,</li>\r\n<li>Traceability for after-sales service.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This more advanced case of handling problems in procurement will be sorted out later in the chapter.</p>\r\n<h3>The Sales Order</h3>\r\n<p>Begin by encoding a sales (or customer) order through the menu <code>Sales &gt; Sales &gt; Quotation -&gt; Create</code>. Enter the following information:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Customer</code>: Agrolait,</li>\r\n<li><code>Create Invoice</code>: On Delivery Order (Other Information tab),</li>\r\n<li><code>Sales Order Lines</code>, click Add an item:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Product</code>: [LAP-CUS] Laptop Customised,</li>\r\n<li><code>Quantity (UoM)</code>: 1,</li>\r\n<li><code>Product UoM</code>: Unit(s),</li>\r\n<li><code>Procurement Method</code>: on order.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once the quotation has been entered, you can confirm it immediately by clicking the button Confirm Sale at the top. Keep note of the order reference because this follows all through the process. For example, this will be <code>SO009</code>. At this stage <code>SO010</code></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mrp_sales_process_new.png\" alt=\"mrp sales process new\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Process for Handling Sales Order SO010</code></em></p>\r\n<h3>Producing an Intermediate Product</h3>\r\n<p>To understand the implications of requirements calculation, you should know the configuration of the sold product. To do this, go to the form for product LAP-CUS and click the <code>Product BoM Structure</code> from the more button. You get the screen shown in Composition of LAP-CUS which is the composition of the selected product.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mrp_product_bom_tree_new.png\" alt=\"mrp product bom tree new\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Composition of LAP-CUS</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The LAP-CUS Customised Laptop has to be manufactured in two steps:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The intermediate product: LP-Kit.</li>\r\n<li>The finished product using that intermediate product: LAP-CUS.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The manufacturing supervisor can then consult the production orders using the menu <code>Manufacturing &gt; Manufacturing &gt; Manufacturing Orders</code>.

Return to the Manufacturing order for LP-Kit and click it. If there are several of them, select the one corresponding to your order using the source document that contains your order number (in this example <code>SO010</code>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mrp_production_form_new.png\" alt=\"mrp production form new\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Details of a Production Order</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The system shows you that you have to manufacture product LAP-CUS using the components: LP-Kit.

Enter a serial number for it by putting the cursor in the field <code>Serial Number</code> and to create a new <code>Number</code>. Enter an internal reference, for example: MB1345678. The system may then show you a warning because this lot is not in stock, but you can ignore this message.</p>\r\n<p>Click the <code>Produce</code> button to manufacture the finished product.</p>\r\n<p>The production order has to be in the closed state as shown in the figure <code>Production Order after the Different Stages</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mrp_production_form_end_new.png\" alt=\"mrp production form end new\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Production Order after the Different Stages</code></em></p>\r\n<h3>Finished Product Manufacturing</h3>\r\n<p>Having manufactured the intermediate product LP-Kit, Odoo automatically proposes the manufacturing of the computer LAP-CUS using the order created earlier. Return to the Manufacturing Orders menu and look at the orders Ready to Produce through <code>Manufacturing &gt; Manufacturing &gt; Manufacturing Orders</code>.</p>\r\n<p>You will find LAP-CUS which has been sold to the customer (source document <code>SO010</code>), as shown in the figure hereafter.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mrp_production_list_end_new.png\" alt=\"mrp production list end new\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Completed Production for LAP-CUS</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Now that the production has been completed, the product sold to the customer has been manufactured and the raw materials have been consumed and taken out of stock.</p>\r\n<p>As well as managing the use of materials and the production of stocks, manufacturing can have the following automatic effects which are detailed further on in the chapter:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>adding value to stock,</li>\r\n<li>generating operations for assembly staff,</li>\r\n<li>automatically creating analytical accounting entries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Subproduct Production</h3>\r\n<p>If you need to manage subproducts, you should install the module <code>mrp_byproduct</code> Go to menu <code>Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Manufacturing</code>. And in Order, tick <code>Produce several products</code>. The normal behaviour of manufacturing in Odoo enables you to manufacture several units of the same finished product from raw materials (A + B &gt; C). With Subproduct management, the manufacturing result can be to have both finished products and secondary products (A + B &gt; C + D).</p>\r\n<p>In Odoo, subproduct material corresponds to secondary products that are a by-product of the main manufacturing process. For example, cutting planks of timber will produce other planks but these bits of timber are too small (or the offcuts may have value for the company if they can be used elsewhere).</p>\r\n<p>If the module <code>mrp_byproduct</code> has been installed, you get a new tab <code>By products</code> in the Bill of Material that lets you set secondary products resulting from the manufacturing of the finished product.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mrp_bom_subproduct_copy.png\" alt=\"mrp bom subproduct copy\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Definition of Subproducts</code></em></p>\r\n<p>When Odoo ERPOnline generates a production order based on a bill of materials that uses a secondary product, you pick up the list of all products in the second tab of the production order <code>Finished Products</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mrp_production.png\" alt=\"mrp production\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Production Order producing Several Finished Products</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Secondary products enable you to generate several types of products from the same raw materials and manufacturing methods - only these are not used in the calculation of requirements. Then, if you need the secondary products, Odoo will not ask you to manufacture another product to use the waste products and secondary products of this production. In this case, you should enter another production order for the secondary product.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike most software for production management, Odoo manages services as well as stockable products. So it is possible to put products of type Service in a bill of materials. These do not appear in the production order, but their requirements will be taken into account.</p>\r\n<p>If they are defined as Make to Order, Odoo will generate a task for the manufacturing or a subcontract order for the operations. The behaviour will depend on the Supply Method configured in the product form: Buy or Produce.</p>\r\n<h3>Scrapping</h3>\r\n<p>If you have to scrap the final product before it is finished, you will have to scrap every component allowed for this product.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mo_scrap.png\" alt=\"mo scrap\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Scrapping a Product to Finish</code></em></p>\r\n<p>If you scrap a Product to Finish, you will get the situation illustrated in the previous figure. A finished product will be <code>created</code> and put in the scrapped virtual location. A new Product to Finish has been added to the manufacturing order.</p>\r\n<p>This new product has been added for the following reason: when you have to manufacture a product and if this product has to be scrapped, you have to produce another product to replace the scrapped one. The reason why you have to scrap each component manually is that the production problem can come from one component.</p>\r\n<p>If the production process is finished and you see that you have to scrap the finished product, you will not have to scrap the different components. They are already <code>consumed</code>. They are not available anymore for further manufacturing orders; they have been moved to the production Stock Location.</p>\r\n<h3>Production Orders</h3>\r\n<p>To open a Production Order, use the menu <code>Manufacturing &gt; Manufacturing &gt; Manufacturing Orders</code> and click the <code>Create</code> button. You get a blank form to enter a new production order as shown in the figure <code>New Production Order</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mrp_production_new.png\" alt=\"mrp production new\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>New Production Order</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The production order follows the process given by the figure <code>Process for Handling a Production Order</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mrp_production_processus.png\" alt=\"mrp production processus\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Process for Handling a Production Order</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The Scheduled date , Product Qty , Name and Default Locations, are automatically completed when the form is first opened. Enter the product that you want to produce, and the quantity required. The <code>Product UOM</code> by default completed automatically by Odoo when the product is first selected.</p>\r\n<p>You then have to set two locations:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The location from which the required raw materials should be found, and</li>\r\n<li>The location for depositing the finished products.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The field <code>Bill of Materials</code> will automatically be completed by Odoo when you select the product. You can then overwrite it with another BoM to specify something else to use for this specific manufacturing.</p>\r\n<p>The tabs <code>Scheduled Products</code> and <code>Work Orders</code> are also completed automatically when you click <code>Compute Data</code> (in the Work Orders or Scheduled Products tabs). You will find the raw materials there that are required for the production and the operations needed by the assembly staff.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to start production, click the button <code>Confirm Production</code>, and Odoo automatically completes the <code>Products to Consume</code> field in the <code>Consumed Products</code> tab and <code>Products to Produce</code> field in <code>Finished Products</code> tab.</p>\r\n<p>The information in the <code>Consumed Products</code> tab can be changed if:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>you want to enter a serial number for raw materials,</li>\r\n<li>you want to change the quantities consumed (lost during production).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For traceability, you can set serial numbers on the raw materials used, or on the finished products. Note the <code>Serial Number</code> and <code>Pack</code> numbers.</p>\r\n<p>Once the order is confirmed, you should force the reservation of materials using the <code>Force Reservation</code> button. This means that you do not have to wait for the scheduler to assign and reserve the raw materials from your stock for this production run. This shortens the procurement process.</p>\r\n<p>If you do not want to change the priorities, just leave the production order in this state and the scheduler will create a plan based on the priority and your planned date.</p>\r\n<p>To start the production of products, click <code>Mark as Started</code>. The raw materials are then consumed automatically from stock, which means that the <code>Ready to Produce</code> movements become <code>Production Started</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Once the production is complete, click <code>Produce</code>. The finished products are now moved into stock.</p>', '1', '32', '2015-08-17 03:43:59', '836', '', '2015-08-17 04:37:24', '836', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-08-17 03:43:59', '0000-00-00
