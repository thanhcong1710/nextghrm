the concept of \\u201cinvoice\\u201d includes the following documents:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The Customer Invoice.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The Supplier Invoice.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>A Customer Credit Note or Customer Refund.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>A Supplier Credit Note or Supplier Refund.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Only the invoice type and the representation mode differ for each of the four documents. But they are all stored in the same object type in the system. You get the correct form for each of the four types of invoice from the menu you use to open it. The name of the tab enables you to tell the invoice types apart when you are working on them.<\\/p>\\r\\n\",\"fulltext\":\"\\r\\n<p>There are many advantages in deriving the different types of invoice from the same object. Two of the most important are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>In a multi-company environment with inter-company invoicing, a customer invoice in one company becomes a supplier invoice for the other.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>This enables you to work and search for all invoices from the same menu. If you are looking for an invoicing history, Odoo provides both supplier and customer invoices in the same list, as well as credit notes.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>A credit note is a document that enables you to cancel an invoice or part of an invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To access customer invoices in Odoo, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Customers &gt; Customer Invoices<\\/code>, and for supplier invoices, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Suppliers &gt; Supplier Invoices<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Most of the time, invoices are generated automatically by Odoo as they are generated from other processes in the system. So it is not usually necessary to create them manually, but simply approve or validate them. Odoo uses the following different ways of generating invoices:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>From Supplier or Customer Orders.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From receipt or dispatch of goods.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From work carried out (timesheets, see <a href=\\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=28&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;Itemid=213\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Key Features HR\\\">Key Features HR<\\/a>).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From closed tasks (see <a href=\\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:drive-your-projects&amp;catid=33:project-management&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;Itemid=213\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Drive your Projects\\\">Drive your Projects<\\/a>).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From fee charges or other rechargeable expenses.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The different processes generate <code>Draft<\\/code> invoices. These must then be approved by a suitable system user and sent to the customer. The different invoicing methods are detailed in the following sections and chapters.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is also possible to enter invoices manually. This is usually done for invoices that are not associated with an order (usually purchase orders) or <code>Credit Notes<\\/code>. Also, if the system has not been configured correctly you might need to edit the invoice before sending it to the customer.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For example, if you have not realized that the customer is tax-exempt, the invoice you generate from an order will contain tax at the normal rates. It is then possible to edit this out of the invoice before validating it.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"customerinvoice\\\">Entering a Customer Invoice<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>The principle of entering data for invoices in Odoo is very simple, as it enables non- accountant users to create their own invoices. This means that your accounting information can be kept up-to-date all the time as orders are placed and received, and their taxes are calculated.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>At the same time, it allows people who have more accounting knowledge to keep full control over the accounting entries that are being generated. Each value proposed by Odoo can be modified later if needed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Start by manually entering a customer invoice. Use <code>Accounting &gt; Customers &gt; Customer Invoices<\\/code> and click on <code>Create<\\/code> button for this.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A new invoice form opens for entering information.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_customer_invoice.png\\\" alt=\\\"account customer invoice\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Entering a New Invoice<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The document is composed of three parts:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The top of the invoice, with customer information.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The main body of the invoice, with detailed invoice lines.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The bottom of the page, with some additional information, taxes, and the totals.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>To enter a document in Odoo ERPOnline, you should always fill in fields in the order they appear on screen. Doing it this way means that some of the later fields are filled in automatically from the selections made in earlier fields. So select the Customer, and the following fields are completed automatically:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The invoice address corresponds to the customer contact that was given the address type of Invoice in the customer form (or otherwise the address type of Default).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The customer account corresponds to the account given in the Accounting which is found in a tab of the customer form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>A specific or a default payment condition can be defined for this customer in the <code>Accounting<\\/code> tab of the customer form. Payment conditions are generated by rules for the payment of the invoice. For example: 50% in 21 days and 50% in 60 days from the end of the month.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h3>Properties Fields<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The Properties fields on the Customer form or the Product form are multi-company fields. The value that the user sees in these fields depends on the company that the user works for.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you work in a multi-company environment that is using one database, you have several charts of accounts. Asset and liability accounts for a customer depend on the company that the user works for.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can reach more information from certain relation fields in Odoo.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In Odoo, a relation is commonly a hyperlink - it takes you to the main form for that entity, with all of the actions and links.<br \\/>So one way or another you can rapidly reach the customer\'s:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Current sales and purchases.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>CRM requests.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Open invoices.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Accounts records.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Payable and receivable accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can add more detailed additional information to the invoice and select the currency that you want to invoice in. Once the invoice heading is saved, you must enter the different invoice lines. You could use either of the two techniques:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Enter the whole field manually.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Use a product to complete the different fields automatically.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The invoice line description is more of a title than a comment. If you want to add more detailed comments you can use the field <code>Additional Information<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So select the product <code>Laptop Customized<\\/code> in the product field in an invoice line. The following fields are then completed automatically:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Description<\\/code>: this comes from the product, in the language of the partner.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Account<\\/code>: determined by the purchase or sales account defined in the product properties. If no account is specified in the product form, Odoo uses the properties of the category that the product is associated with.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Unit of Measure<\\/code>: this is defined by default in the product form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Unit Price<\\/code>: this is given by the sales price in the product form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Taxes<\\/code>: provided by the product form and the partner form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>By default, Odoo invoices and processes the price without taxes \\u2013 they are managed as a separate amount. Odoo can manage tax inclusive prices when you check the Tax Included in Price field true when configuring the tax.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can enter several invoice lines and modify the values that are automatically completed by Odoo. Once the invoice lines have been entered, you can click (update) on the invoice to get the details of tax calculated such as:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Untaxed Amount.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Tax Amount.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Total Amount.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>In the <code>Other Info<\\/code> tab at the bottom you will find the details of the total calculated for different tax rates used in the invoice. Before approving the invoice you can modify the date and the accounting period, which are entered by default as today\'s date. A click on PRO-FORMA moves from the <code>Draft<\\/code> to <code>Pro-forma<\\/code> state. And click <code>Validate<\\/code> when you want to approve the invoice. It moves from the <code>Draft<\\/code> state to the <code>Open<\\/code> state.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In order to get the PRO-FORMA button on invoice, go to the menu <code>Settings &gt; Accounting, eInvoicing &amp; Payments<\\/code> section and click the boolean field <code>Allow pro-forma invoices<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you have validated an invoice, Odoo gives it a unique number from a defined sequence. By default it takes the form Journal Code\\/Year\\/Sequence Number for example, <code>SAJ\\/2010\\/005<\\/code>. You cannot modify an invoice number, but instead, you should modify the sequence numbers through the menu <code>Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounting, eInvoicing &amp; Payments<\\/code> section and provide <code>Next Invoice<\\/code> number<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Accounting entries corresponding to this invoice are automatically generated when you approve the invoice. You see the details by clicking the entry in the <code>Journal Entry<\\/code> field and searching there for the account moves generated by that invoice number.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Furthermore, you can also <code>Print<\\/code> or <code>Email<\\/code> your Invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"tax\\\">Tax Management<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Details on the product form determine the selection of applicable taxes for an invoice line. By default, Odoo takes account of all the taxes defined in the product form. Take the case of the following product:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Applicable taxes:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>TVA: 19.6% type TVA.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>DEEE: 5.5, type DEEE.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The DEEE tax (disposal of electronic and electrical equipment) is an ecological tax that was imposed in France from 2009. It is applied to batteries to finance their recycling and is a fixed sum that is applied to the before-tax amount on the invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you trade with a company in your own country, and your country has a DEEE-type tax, the applicable taxes for this invoice could be:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>DEEE: 5.5.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>TVA: 19.6%.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>If you sell to a customer in another company in the community (intracommunity), instead, then tax is not charged. In the partner form, in the tab <code>Accounting<\\/code>, the field <code>Fiscal Position<\\/code> maintains information whether the customer is within the region or not. When you create an invoice for this customer, Odoo will calculate the following taxes on the product:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>DEEE: 5.5.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>TVA intracommunity: 0%.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>If you have not entered the parameters in the customer form correctly, Odoo will suggest incorrect taxes in the invoice. That is not a real issue, because you can always modify the information directly in the invoice before approving it.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you create an invoice for a product that will only be bought or sold once, you do not have to encode a new product. Instead, you will have to provide quite a bit of information manually on the invoice line:<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Product Description.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Account.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Quantity.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Unit Price<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"cancelinvoice\\\">Cancelling an Invoice<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>By default, Odoo will not allow you to cancel an invoice once it has been approved. Since accounting entries have been created, you theoretically cannot go back and delete them. However, in some cases, it is more convenient to cancel an invoice when there is an error than to produce a credit note and reconcile the two entries. Your attitude to this will be influenced by current legislation in your accounting jurisdiction and your adherence to accounting purity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo accommodates either approach. Install the <code>account_cancel<\\/code> module. Then allow cancelling an invoice by checking the box <code>Allow Cancelling Entries<\\/code> in the Journal corresponding to this invoice. You will then be allowed to cancel the invoice if the following two conditions are met:<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote><ol>\\r\\n<li>The accounting entries have not been reconciled or paid: if they have, then you will have to cancel the reconciliation first.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The accounting period or the fiscal year has not already been closed: if it is closed then no modification is possible.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Cancelling an invoice has the effect of automatically modifying the corresponding accounting entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To be able to cancel invoices, you should install the module <code>account_cancel<\\/code>. You can cancel an invoice if the <code>Allow Cancelling Entries<\\/code> function has been activated in the journal and the entries have not yet been reconciled. You could then move it from <code>Cancelled<\\/code> to the <code>Draft<\\/code> state to modify it and regenerate it.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Some countries require you to have contiguously numbered invoices (that is, with no break in the sequence). If, after cancelling an invoice that you are not regenerating, you find yourself with a break in the numbering you would have to go and modify the sequence, redo the invoice and replace the sequence number with its original value.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can control the sequences using the menu <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Sequences &amp; Identifiers &gt; Sequences<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Cancelling an invoice will cause a break in the number sequence of your invoices. You are strongly advised to recreate this invoice and re-approve it to fill the hole in the numbering if you can.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The duplication function can be applied to all the system documents: you can duplicate anything \\u2013 a product, an order, or a delivery.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Instead of entering a new invoice each time, you can base an invoice on a similar preceding one and duplicate it. To do this, first search for a suitable existing invoice. In the web client, show the invoice in read-only (non-editable) form view, then click on <code>More<\\/code> and <code>Duplicate<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The duplication creates a new invoice in the <code>Draft<\\/code> state. That enables you to modify it before approving it. Duplicating documents in Odoo is an intelligent function, which enables the duplicated invoice to be given its own sequence number, today\'s date, and the draft state, even if the preceding invoice has been paid.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"supplierinvoice\\\">Creating a Supplier Invoice<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>The form that manages supplier invoices is very similar to the one for customer invoices. However, it has been adapted to simplify rapid data entry and monitoring of the amounts recorded.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Many companies do not enter data on supplier invoices, but simply enter accounting data corresponding to the purchase journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This particularly applies to users that have focused on the accounting system rather than all the capabilities provided by an ERP system. The two approaches reach the same accounting result: some prefer one and others prefer the other depending on their skills.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>However, when you use the Purchase Management functions in Odoo you should work directly on invoices because they are provided from <code>Purchase Orders<\\/code> or <code>Goods Receipt<\\/code> documents.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To enter a new supplier invoice, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Suppliers &gt; Supplier Invoices<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Everything is similar to the customer invoice, starting with the Journal unless the default is acceptable, and then the Supplier, which will automatically complete the following fields<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Partner Account.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Unlike the customer invoice, you do not have to enter payment conditions \\u2013 simply a <code>Due Date<\\/code> if you want one. If you do not give a due date, Odoo assumes that this invoice will be paid in cash. If you want to enter more complete payment conditions than just the due date, you can use the <code>Payment Term<\\/code> field which you can find on the second tab <code>Other Info<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Indicate the <code>Currency<\\/code> if the invoice is not going to use the default currency, then you can enter the <code>Invoice Lines<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Just like the customer invoice, you have the choice of entering all the information manually or use a product to complete many of the fields automatically. When you enter a product, all of the following values are completed automatically:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The product <code>Account<\\/code> is completed from the properties of the product form or the Category of the product if nothing is defined on the product itself.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The <code>Taxes<\\/code> come from the product form and\\/or the partner form, based on the same principles as the customer invoice.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The <code>Quantity<\\/code> is set at 1 by default but can be changed manually.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Unit Price<\\/code>: this is given by the cost price in the product form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can click (<code>update<\\/code>) on the invoice in the <code>Edit<\\/code> mode to get the details of tax calculated. Odoo automatically completes the <code>Invoice Date<\\/code> and the accounting period.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Accounting periods are treated as legal period declarations. For example, a tax declaration for an invoice depends on the accounting period and not on the date of invoicing.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Depending on whether your declarations are made monthly or quarterly, the fiscal year contains either twelve or four accounting periods.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The dates are shown in the document you created in the accounting system. They are used for calculating due dates.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The two pieces of information do not have to have the same date. If, for example, you receive an invoice dated <code>5th January<\\/code> which relates to goods or services supplied before <code>31st December<\\/code>, the invoice may be coded into the <code>December<\\/code> accounting period and thus be recognized in that period for the tax declaration, while the invoice can remain <code>5th January<\\/code> which remains the basis of the due date for payment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can find that the amounts do not correspond with what your supplier has given you on paper for reasons that can include:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The supplier made a calculation error.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The amounts have been rounded differently.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h3>Rounding Tax<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>It often happens that a supplier adds 1 to the total because the tax calculation has been rounded upwards. Some tax amounts are not valid because of this rounding.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For example, it is impossible to arrive at the amount of 145.50 if you are working to a precision of 2 decimal places and a rate of 19.6%:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>121.65 x 1.196 = 145.49<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>121.66 x 1.196 = 145.51<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>In this case you can add a row in the Taxes so that you can adjust a total.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When the totals tally, you can validate the invoice. Odoo then generates the corresponding accounting entries. You can manage those entries using the <code>Account<\\/code> fields on the invoice and on each of the invoice lines.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"refund\\\">Credit Notes \\/ Refunds<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Entering a customer credit note is almost identical to entering a customer invoice. You just start from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Customers &gt; Customer Refunds<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Similarly, entering a supplier credit note is the same as that of the supplier invoice, and so you use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Suppliers &gt; Supplier Refunds<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is easy to generate a credit note quickly from an existing invoice. To do this, select a customer or supplier invoice which is in <code>Paid<\\/code> state and click the <code>Refund<\\/code> button. Odoo opens a new payment invoice form for you in the <code>Draft<\\/code> state so that you can modify it before approval.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Below you find the different options displayed when you click the <code>Refund<\\/code> button on an invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Create a Draft Refund<\\/code>: Creates a draft credit note of the complete invoice. You can change this credit note, i.e. to make a partial credit note.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Modify<\\/code>: Creates a credit note for the existing invoice, validates the credit note and reconciles it with the invoice. The existing invoice is duplicated so that you can modify it.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Cancel<\\/code>: Creates a credit note for the complete invoice, validates the credit note and reconciles it with the invoice concerned.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"payment\\\">Payments<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>An invoice is automatically marked as <code>Paid<\\/code> by Odoo once invoice entries have been reconciled with payment entries. You yourself do not have to mark the invoices as paid: Odoo manages that when you reconcile your payments.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Generally, you reconcile the invoice\'s accounting entries with their payment(s). But you can also reconcile an invoice with the entries from the corresponding credit note instead, to mutually cancel them.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You have seen the <code>Register Payment<\\/code> button in the invoice form which is in <code>Open<\\/code> state. This lets you enter payments and get entries reconciled very quickly.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also manage the payment of invoices when you are entering bank statements and cash transactions. These allow better control of financial transactions and permit greater flexibility in areas such as:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Advance and partial payments of invoices.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Payment of several invoices by several payments.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Fine-grained management of different due dates on the same invoices.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Management of adjustments if there are different amounts to those on the invoice.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\",\"state\":\"1\",\"catid\":\"27\",\"created\":\"2015-08-09 01:24:48\",\"created_by\":\"836\",\"created_by_alias\":\"\",\"modified\":\"2015-08-14 00:10:34\",\"modified_by\":\"836\",\"checked_out\":\"0\",\"checked_out_time\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"publish_up\":\"2015-08-09 01:24:48\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":\"6\",\"ordering\":2,\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"In Odoo, the concept of \\u201cinvoice\\u201d includes the following documents: The Customer Invoice;

Use code 0 to indicate the root account and the account name.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Parent<\\/code>: determines which account is the parent of this one, to create the tree structure of the chart of accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Internal Type<\\/code>: internal types have special effects in Odoo. By default, the following types are available: <code>View<\\/code> can be used to create a hierarchical structure for your accounts (grouping), <code>Regular<\\/code> any account that does not fit into one of the other types; most of the accounts will have this type, <code>Receivable<\\/code> - <code>Payable<\\/code>: these types are used to indicate the centralisation accounts (for customers and suppliers) that will be set for each partner, <code>Liquidity<\\/code> used to indicate financial accounts (bank and cash accounts), Consolidation to create a virtual (or consolidation) chart of accounts, Closed to indicate accounts that are no longer used.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Account Type<\\/code>: it is important to select the corresponding account type, as explained above. This will have an impact at year closing and also when printing reports.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Secondary Currency<\\/code>: forces all the moves for this account to have this secondary currency. Note that you can also define exchange rates from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Currencies<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Outgoing Currencies Rate<\\/code>: to be selected only when you add a secondary currency.

Activate this field for receivable and payable accounts and any other account that need to be reconciled other than by bank statements.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Default Taxes<\\/code>: this is the default tax applied to purchases or sales using this account. It enables the system to propose tax entries automatically when entering data in a journal manually.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The tree structure of the accounts can be altered as often and as much as you wish without recalculating any of the individual entries. So you can easily restructure your account during the year to reflect the reality of the company better.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can have a look at active charts of accounts using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Chart of Accounts<\\/code>, and <code>Open Charts<\\/code> for the selected year, account moves and periods. Click an account to drill down to its details.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Most accounting software packages represent their charts of accounts in the form of a list. You can do this in Odoo as well if you want to, but its tree view offers several advantages:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>It lets you show in detail only the accounts that interest you.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>It enables you to get a global view of accounts (when you show only summary accounts).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>It is more intuitive, because you can search for accounts on the basis of their classification.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>It is flexible because you can easily restructure them.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The structure of the chart of accounts is hierarchical, with account subtotals calculated from the <code>View<\\/code> accounts. You can develop a set of view accounts to contain only those elements that interest you.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To get the details of the account entries that are important to you, all you need to do is click the account\'s code or name.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Displaying the chart of accounts can take several seconds, because Odoo calculates the debits, credits and balance for each account in real time.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Virtual Charts of Accounts<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The structure of a chart of accounts is imposed by the legislation in effect in the country concerned. Unfortunately, that structure does not always correspond to the view that a company needs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In Odoo, you can use the concept of virtual charts of accounts to manage several representations of the same accounts simultaneously. These representations can be shown in real time with no additional data entry.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So your general chart of accounts can be the one imposed by the statutes of your country, and your CEO can then have other virtual charts as necessary, based on the accounts in the general chart. For example, you can create a view per department, a cash-flow and liquidity view, or consolidated accounts for different companies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The most interesting thing about virtual charts of accounts is that they can be used in the same way as the default chart of accounts for the whole organization. For example, you can establish budgets from your consolidated accounts or the accounts from one of your companies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Virtual accounts enable you to provide different representations of one or several existing charts of accounts. Creating and restructuring virtual accounts has no impact on the accounting entries. You can then use the virtual charts with no risk of altering the general chart of accounts or future accounting entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Because they are used only to get a different representation of the same entries, they are very useful for:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Consolidating several companies in real time.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Reporting to a holding according to their chart of accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Depreciation calculations.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Cash-flow views.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Getting more useful views than those imposed.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Presenting summary charts to other users that are appropriate to their general system rights.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>So there are good reasons for viewing the impact of financial transactions through virtual charts, such as budgets and financial indicators based on special views of the company.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To create a new chart of accounts you should create a root account using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Accounts<\\/code>. Your top level account should have a name, a code (different from any other code in your current chart), an <code>Internal Type<\\/code> and <code>Account Type View<\\/code>. Then you can choose your structure by creating other accounts of Account Type View as necessary. The <code>Internal Type<\\/code> should be of the Consolidation type if you want to map accounts. Check your virtual structure using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Charts of Accounts<\\/code> and select the corresponding chart in the drop-down list at the top of the screen.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To be able to map your virtual chart of accounts to your general chart of accounts, you have to set Internal Type as <code>Consolidation<\\/code>. From the Consolidated Children you can then map accounts or make accounts consolidate. In the <code>Consolidated Children<\\/code>, you can add <code>View<\\/code> accounts or normal accounts. If you add a View account to the consolidated children, Odoo will automatically include all existing and future linked accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_virtual.png\\\" alt=\\\"account virtual\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Virtual Accounts Mapped to View Account<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can then run reports such as <code>Trial Balance<\\/code> and <code>General Ledger<\\/code> for both your general chart of accounts and your virtual chart(s) giving you another representation of the company. All the actions and states in your general account are also available in the virtual accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Finally, you can also make virtual charts of accounts from other virtual charts. That can give an additional dimension for financial analysis. You can create an unlimited number of virtual (consolidation) charts of accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"fiscalyear\\\">Periods and Financial Years<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>A fiscal year (or financial year) corresponds to twelve months for a company.

This gives you several advantages, such as the possibility to create three-year budgets.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Defining a Period or a Financial Year<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>You can create several years in advance to define long-term budgets, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Periods &gt; Fiscal Years<\\/code>, click on Create enter the date of the first day and the last day of your fiscal year.

Odoo has a flexible mechanism for handling taxation that can be configured to meet the requirements of many tax jurisdictions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The taxation mechanism can also be used to handle other tax-like financial transactions, such as royalties to authors based on the value of transactions through an account.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>From the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Taxes<\\/code> you can define your tax structure. Note that when you use a predefined (localised) chart of accounts, taxes will be configured as well in most cases.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo\'s tax system runs around three major concepts:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Tax Code<\\/code> (or <code>Tax Case<\\/code>), used for tax reporting, can be set up in a hierarchical structure so that multiple codes can be formed into trees in the same way as a <code>Chart of Accounts<\\/code>. The Tax Codes structure is used to define your VAT return; it can be numeric and alphanumeric. You can define tax codes from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Tax Codes<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Taxes<\\/code>, the basic tax object that contains the rules for calculating tax on the transaction it is attached to, linked to the <code>General Accounts<\\/code> and to the <code>Tax Codes<\\/code>. A tax can contain multiple child taxes and base its calculation on those taxes rather than on the base transaction, providing considerable flexibility.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The <code>General Accounts<\\/code>, which record the taxes owing and paid. Since the general accounts are discussed elsewhere in this part of the book and are not tax-specific, they will not be detailed in this section.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can attach zero or more <code>Purchase Taxes<\\/code> and <code>Sale Taxes<\\/code> items to products, so that you can account separately for purchase and sales taxes (or Input and Output VAT \\u2013 where VAT is Value Added Tax). Because you can attach more than one tax, you can handle a VAT or Sales Tax separately from an Eco Tax on the same product.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To create a new Tax Code, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Tax Codes<\\/code>.

This principle can easily be used when posting purchase invoices for which no products are required.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Taxes on Products and Accounts will usually be national taxes. Odoo is capable of automatically converting national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes through the concept of Fiscal Positions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Fiscal Positions<\\/code>. You can use the fiscal positions to automatically convert national taxes to the required intracommunal or export taxes, according to the fiscal position specified for the customer or supplier.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Fiscal positions allow you to make a mapping from national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes, or to map your accounts according to these criteria. You can link fiscal positions to your customers and suppliers to ensure automatic and easy VAT conversion when posting entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"journal\\\">Journals<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>All your accounting entries need to appear in an accounting journal. So you should create a <code>Sales Journal<\\/code> for customer invoices, a Sales Refund journal for customer credit notes, a Purchase Journal for supplier invoices, a Purchase Refund journal for supplier credit notes and a <code>Bank Journal<\\/code> for bank transactions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Configuring a Journal<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>To view, edit or create new journals use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_journal_form1.png\\\" alt=\\\"account journal form\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Defining an Accounting Journal<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Blue fields are mandatory fields. When you select a journal type, some configuration parameters will be preset. The journal type will tell the system where the journal concerned can be used.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Each journal has a specific way of displaying data. The type of journal determines the journal view, which indicates the fields that need to be visible and are required to enter accounting data in that journal. The view determines both the order of the fields and the properties of each field. For example, the field Statement has to appear when entering data in the bank journal, but not in the other journals.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also create your own journal views. However, before creating a new view for a journal, check whether there is nothing similar already defined. You should only create a new view for new types of journals.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can create a sequence for each journal. This sequence determines the automatic numbering for accounting entries. Several journals can use the same sequence if you want to define one for them all, and if your legislation allows this.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Sequences can also be created from the <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Sequences &amp; Identifiers &gt; Sequences<\\/code>. By default, Odoo has only one sequence in the journal definition. If you need two separate sequences to be kept for the journal, you can install the module account_sequence.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The default credit and debit account allow the software to automatically generate counterpart entries when you are entering data through <code>Journal Items<\\/code>. In some journals, debit and credit accounts are mandatory. For example, in a bank journal you should put an associated bank account, so that you do not have to create counterparts for each transaction manually.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A journal can be marked as being centralised. When you do this, the counterpart entries will not be owned by each entry, but will be global for the given journal and period. You will then have a credit line and a debit line centralized for each entry in one of these journals, meaning that both credit and debit appear on the same line. This option is used when posting opening entries in a situation journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A bank journal can automatically be created from the bank account(s) you define for your company. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Setup your Bank Accounts<\\/code>. Here you create the bank account or IBAN number of your company\'s bank account(s). Fill in the <code>Bank Name<\\/code>, and when you save the entry, your <code>Bank Journal<\\/code> will automatically be created with the <code>Bank Name<\\/code> and the <code>Account Number<\\/code>. The general ledger account for this bank will also be created for you.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Controls and Tips for Data Entry<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>You can have control on journals in Odoo \\u2013 controls over the accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To avoid entering account data in wrong accounts, you can put conditions on the general accounts about which journal can use a given account. To do this, you have to list all the accounts or valid account types in the second tab, Entry Controls. If you have not added any accounts there, Odoo applies no restriction on the accounts for that journal. If you list accounts and\\/or the types of accounts that can be used in a journal, Odoo prevents you from using any account or account type not in that list. This verification step starts from the moment you enter data. You can only select allowed accounts or account types.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This functionality is useful for limiting possible data entry errors by restricting the accounts to be used in a journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>Control of Data Entry<\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>In accounting it is not a good idea to allow a data entry directly from bank account A to bank account B. If you enter a transaction from bank A to bank B, the transaction will be accounted for twice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To prevent this problem, pass the transaction through intermediate account C. At the time of data entry, the system checks the type of account that is accepted in the bank journal: only accounts that are not of type <code>Bank<\\/code> are accepted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If your accountant defines this control properly, non-accounting users are prevented from transferring payments from one bank to<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\",\"state\":1,\"catid\":\"27\",\"created\":\"2015-08-14 00:10:23\",\"created_by\":\"836\",\"created_by_alias\":\"\",\"modified\":\"2015-08-14 02:14:43\",\"modified_by\":\"836\",\"checked_out\":\"836\",\"checked_out_time\":\"2015-08-14 02:04:52\",\"publish_up\":\"2015-08-14 00:10:23\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":6,\"ordering\":\"4\",\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"This section deals with: managing bank statements, managing cash, manual journal entries.\",\"access\":\"1\",\"hits\":\"2\",\"metadata\":\"{\\\"robots\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"rights\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"xreference\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"featured\":\"0\",\"language\":\"en-GB\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0'), ('846', '94', '1', '', '2015-08-14 04:14:20', '836', '36907', '8ab38f9298518742eaca0ec6b5640117ef154e5d', '{\"id\":94,\"asset_id\":\"265\",\"title\":\"Accounting Entries\",\"alias\":\"accounting-entries\",\"introtext\":\"<p>Various methods can be used to create accounting entries.

You can develop a set of view accounts to contain only those elements that interest you.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To get the details of the account entries that are important to you, all you need to do is click the account\'s code or name.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Displaying the chart of accounts can take several seconds, because Odoo calculates the debits, credits and balance for each account in real time.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Virtual Charts of Accounts<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The structure of a chart of accounts is imposed by the legislation in effect in the country concerned. Unfortunately, that structure does not always correspond to the view that a company needs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In Odoo, you can use the concept of virtual charts of accounts to manage several representations of the same accounts simultaneously. These representations can be shown in real time with no additional data entry.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So your general chart of accounts can be the one imposed by the statutes of your country, and your CEO can then have other virtual charts as necessary, based on the accounts in the general chart. For example, you can create a view per department, a cash-flow and liquidity view, or consolidated accounts for different companies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The most interesting thing about virtual charts of accounts is that they can be used in the same way as the default chart of accounts for the whole organization. For example, you can establish budgets from your consolidated accounts or the accounts from one of your companies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Virtual accounts enable you to provide different representations of one or several existing charts of accounts. Creating and restructuring virtual accounts has no impact on the accounting entries. You can then use the virtual charts with no risk of altering the general chart of accounts or future accounting entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Because they are used only to get a different representation of the same entries, they are very useful for:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Consolidating several companies in real time.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Reporting to a holding according to their chart of accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Depreciation calculations.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Cash-flow views.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Getting more useful views than those imposed.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Presenting summary charts to other users that are appropriate to their general system rights.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>So there are good reasons for viewing the impact of financial transactions through virtual charts, such as budgets and financial indicators based on special views of the company.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To create a new chart of accounts you should create a root account using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Accounts<\\/code>. Your top level account should have a name, a code (different from any other code in your current chart), an <code>Internal Type<\\/code> and <code>Account Type View<\\/code>. Then you can choose your structure by creating other accounts of Account Type View as necessary. The <code>Internal Type<\\/code> should be of the Consolidation type if you want to map accounts. Check your virtual structure using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Charts of Accounts<\\/code> and select the corresponding chart in the drop-down list at the top of the screen.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To be able to map your virtual chart of accounts to your general chart of accounts, you have to set Internal Type as <code>Consolidation<\\/code>. From the Consolidated Children you can then map accounts or make accounts consolidate. In the <code>Consolidated Children<\\/code>, you can add <code>View<\\/code> accounts or normal accounts. If you add a View account to the consolidated children, Odoo will automatically include all existing and future linked accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_virtual.png\\\" alt=\\\"account virtual\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Virtual Accounts Mapped to View Account<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can then run reports such as <code>Trial Balance<\\/code> and <code>General Ledger<\\/code> for both your general chart of accounts and your virtual chart(s) giving you another representation of the company. All the actions and states in your general account are also available in the virtual accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Finally, you can also make virtual charts of accounts from other virtual charts.

Odoo has a flexible mechanism for handling taxation that can be configured to meet the requirements of many tax jurisdictions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The taxation mechanism can also be used to handle other tax-like financial transactions, such as royalties to authors based on the value of transactions through an account.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>From the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Taxes<\\/code> you can define your tax structure. Note that when you use a predefined (localised) chart of accounts, taxes will be configured as well in most cases.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo\'s tax system runs around three major concepts:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Tax Code<\\/code> (or <code>Tax Case<\\/code>), used for tax reporting, can be set up in a hierarchical structure so that multiple codes can be formed into trees in the same way as a <code>Chart of Accounts<\\/code>. The Tax Codes structure is used to define your VAT return; it can be numeric and alphanumeric. You can define tax codes from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Tax Codes<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Taxes<\\/code>, the basic tax object that contains the rules for calculating tax on the transaction it is attached to, linked to the <code>General Accounts<\\/code> and to the <code>Tax Codes<\\/code>. A tax can contain multiple child taxes and base its calculation on those taxes rather than on the base transaction, providing considerable flexibility.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The <code>General Accounts<\\/code>, which record the taxes owing and paid. Since the general accounts are discussed elsewhere in this part of the book and are not tax-specific, they will not be detailed in this section.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can attach zero or more <code>Purchase Taxes<\\/code> and <code>Sale Taxes<\\/code> items to products, so that you can account separately for purchase and sales taxes (or Input and Output VAT \\u2013 where VAT is Value Added Tax). Because you can attach more than one tax, you can handle a VAT or Sales Tax separately from an Eco Tax on the same product.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To create a new Tax Code, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Tax Codes<\\/code>. You should define the following fields:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Tax Case Name<\\/code>: a unique name required to identify the tax case, usually taken from your VAT return.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Case Code<\\/code>: an optional short code for the case.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Parent Code<\\/code>: a link to a parent Tax Code to create a tree structure which can be displayed from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Chart of Taxes<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Not Printable in Invoice<\\/code>: a checkbox allowing you to indicate that any taxes linked to the tax code concerned should not be printed on the invoice.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Coefficient<\\/code> for parent: choose 1.00 to add the total to the parent account or -1.00 to subtract it.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Description<\\/code>: a free text field for documentation purposes.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_def_tax_code_form.png\\\" alt=\\\"account def tax code form\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Tax Code<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also see two read-only fields:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Period Sum<\\/code>: a single figure showing the total accumulated on this case for the current financial period.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Year Sum<\\/code>: a single figure showing the total accumulated on this case for the financial year.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You will probably need to create two tax codes for each different tax rate that you have to define, one for the tax itself and one for the invoice amount (the so-called base code) the tax is computed from.

Assuming you have set up the appropriate taxes, you would use the menu <code>Sales &gt; Products &gt; Products<\\/code> to open and edit a Product definition, then:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Select one or more <code>Sale Taxes<\\/code> for any products that you might sell, which may include a Sales Tax or Output VAT and a Sales Eco Tax.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Select one or more <code>Purchase Taxes<\\/code> for any products that you might purchase, which may include a Purchase Tax or Input VAT and a Purchase Eco Tax.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Generally, when you make a purchase or sales, the taxes assigned to the product are used to calculate the taxes owing or owed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also assign multiple taxes to an account, so that when you transfer money through the account you attract a tax amount. This principle can easily be used when posting purchase invoices for which no products are required.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Taxes on Products and Accounts will usually be national taxes. Odoo is capable of automatically converting national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes through the concept of Fiscal Positions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Fiscal Positions<\\/code>. You can use the fiscal positions to automatically convert national taxes to the required intracommunal or export taxes, according to the fiscal position specified for the customer or supplier.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Fiscal positions allow you to make a mapping from national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes, or to map your accounts according to these criteria. You can link fiscal positions to your customers and suppliers to ensure automatic and easy VAT conversion when posting entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"journal\\\">Journals<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>All your accounting entries need to appear in an accounting journal. So you should create a <code>Sales Journal<\\/code> for customer invoices, a Sales Refund journal for customer credit notes, a Purchase Journal for supplier invoices, a Purchase Refund journal for supplier credit notes and a <code>Bank Journal<\\/code> for bank transactions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Configuring a Journal<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>To view, edit or create new journals use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_journal_form1.png\\\" alt=\\\"account journal form\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Defining an Accounting Journal<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Blue fields are mandatory fields. When you select a journal type, some configuration parameters will be preset. The journal type will tell the system where the journal concerned can be used.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Each journal has a specific way of displaying data. The type of journal determines the journal view, which indicates the fields that need to be visible and are required to enter accounting data in that journal. The view determines both the order of the fields and the properties of each field. For example, the field Statement has to appear when entering data in the bank journal, but not in the other journals.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also create your own journal views. However, before creating a new view for a journal, check whether there is nothing similar already defined. You should only create a new view for new types of journals.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can create a sequence for each journal. This sequence determines the automatic numbering for accounting entries. Several journals can use the same sequence if you want to define one for them all, and if your legislation allows this.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Sequences can also be created from the <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Sequences &amp; Identifiers &gt; Sequences<\\/code>. By default, Odoo has only one sequence in the journal definition. If you need two separate sequences to be kept for the journal, you can install the module account_sequence.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The default credit and debit account allow the software to automatically generate counterpart entries when you are entering data through <code>Journal Items<\\/code>. In some journals, debit and credit accounts are mandatory. For example, in a bank journal you should put an associated bank account, so that you do not have to create counterparts for each transaction manually.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A journal can be marked as being centralised. When you do this, the counterpart entries will not be owned by each entry, but will be global for the given journal and period. You will then have a credit line and a debit line centralized for each entry in one of these journals, meaning that both credit and debit appear on the same line. This option is used when posting opening entries in a situation journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A bank journal can automatically be created from the bank account(s) you define for your company. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Setup your Bank Accounts<\\/code>. Here you create the bank account or IBAN number of your company\'s bank account(s). Fill in the <code>Bank Name<\\/code>, and when you save the entry, your <code>Bank Journal<\\/code> will automatically be created with the <code>Bank Name<\\/code> and the <code>Account Number<\\/code>. The general ledger account for this bank will also be created for you.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Controls and Tips for Data Entry<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>You can have control on journals in Odoo \\u2013 controls over the accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To avoid entering account data in wrong accounts, you can put conditions on the general accounts about which journal can use a given account. To do this, you have to list all the accounts or valid account types in the second tab, Entry Controls. If you have not added any accounts there, Odoo applies no restriction on the accounts for that journal. If you list accounts and\\/or the types of accounts that can be used in a journal, Odoo prevents you from using any account or account type not in that list. This verification step starts from the moment you enter data. You can only select allowed accounts or account types.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This functionality is useful for limiting possible data entry errors by restricting the accounts to be used in a journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>Control of Data Entry<\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>In accounting it is not a good idea to allow a data entry directly from bank account A to bank account B. If you enter a transaction from bank A to bank B, the transaction will be accounted for twice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To prevent this problem, pass the transaction through intermediate account C. At the time of data entry, the system checks the type of account that is accepted in the bank journal: only accounts that are not of type <code>Bank<\\/code> are accepted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If your accountant defines this control properly, non-accounting users are prevented from transferring payments from one bank to<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"paymentterm\\\">Payment Terms<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>You can define whatever payment terms you need in Odoo.

The delay Day of the Month can be set to <code>-1<\\/code> , <code>0<\\/code> or any positive number. For example, if today is 20th December 2012, and if you want to set payment terms like this:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>5000 within 5 days<\\/code>: set Valuation Fixed Amount, Number of Days 5 and Day of the Month 0.

So you can easily restructure your account during the year to reflect the reality of the company better.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can have a look at active charts of accounts using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Chart of Accounts<\\/code>, and <code>Open Charts<\\/code> for the selected year, account moves and periods. Click an account to drill down to its details.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Most accounting software packages represent their charts of accounts in the form of a list. You can do this in Odoo as well if you want to, but its tree view offers several advantages:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>It lets you show in detail only the accounts that interest you.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>It enables you to get a global view of accounts (when you show only summary accounts).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>It is more intuitive, because you can search for accounts on the basis of their classification.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>It is flexible because you can easily restructure them.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The structure of the chart of accounts is hierarchical, with account subtotals calculated from the <code>View<\\/code> accounts. You can develop a set of view accounts to contain only those elements that interest you.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To get the details of the account entries that are important to you, all you need to do is click the account\'s code or name.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Displaying the chart of accounts can take several seconds, because Odoo calculates the debits, credits and balance for each account in real time.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Virtual Charts of Accounts<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The structure of a chart of accounts is imposed by the legislation in effect in the country concerned. Unfortunately, that structure does not always correspond to the view that a company needs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In Odoo, you can use the concept of virtual charts of accounts to manage several representations of the same accounts simultaneously. These representations can be shown in real time with no additional data entry.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So your general chart of accounts can be the one imposed by the statutes of your country, and your CEO can then have other virtual charts as necessary, based on the accounts in the general chart. For example, you can create a view per department, a cash-flow and liquidity view, or consolidated accounts for different companies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The most interesting thing about virtual charts of accounts is that they can be used in the same way as the default chart of accounts for the whole organization. For example, you can establish budgets from your consolidated accounts or the accounts from one of your companies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Virtual accounts enable you to provide different representations of one or several existing charts of accounts. Creating and restructuring virtual accounts has no impact on the accounting entries. You can then use the virtual charts with no risk of altering the general chart of accounts or future accounting entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Because they are used only to get a different representation of the same entries, they are very useful for:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Consolidating several companies in real time.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Reporting to a holding according to their chart of accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Depreciation calculations.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Cash-flow views.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Getting more useful views than those imposed.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Presenting summary charts to other users that are appropriate to their general system rights.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>So there are good reasons for viewing the impact of financial transactions through virtual charts, such as budgets and financial indicators based on special views of the company.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To create a new chart of accounts you should create a root account using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Accounts<\\/code>. Your top level account should have a name, a code (different from any other code in your current chart), an <code>Internal Type<\\/code> and <code>Account Type View<\\/code>. Then you can choose your structure by creating other accounts of Account Type View as necessary. The <code>Internal Type<\\/code> should be of the Consolidation type if you want to map accounts. Check your virtual structure using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Charts of Accounts<\\/code> and select the corresponding chart in the drop-down list at the top of the screen.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To be able to map your virtual chart of accounts to your general chart of accounts, you have to set Internal Type as <code>Consolidation<\\/code>. From the Consolidated Children you can then map accounts or make accounts consolidate. In the <code>Consolidated Children<\\/code>, you can add <code>View<\\/code> accounts or normal accounts. If you add a View account to the consolidated children, Odoo will automatically include all existing and future linked accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_virtual.png\\\" alt=\\\"account virtual\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Virtual Accounts Mapped to View Account<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can then run reports such as <code>Trial Balance<\\/code> and <code>General Ledger<\\/code> for both your general chart of accounts and your virtual chart(s) giving you another representation of the company. All the actions and states in your general account are also available in the virtual accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Finally, you can also make virtual charts of accounts from other virtual charts. That can give an additional dimension for financial analysis. You can create an unlimited number of virtual (consolidation) charts of accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"fiscalyear\\\">Periods and Financial Years<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>A fiscal year (or financial year) corresponds to twelve months for a company.

You can define tax codes from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Tax Codes<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Taxes<\\/code>, the basic tax object that contains the rules for calculating tax on the transaction it is attached to, linked to the <code>General Accounts<\\/code> and to the <code>Tax Codes<\\/code>. A tax can contain multiple child taxes and base its calculation on those taxes rather than on the base transaction, providing considerable flexibility.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The <code>General Accounts<\\/code>, which record the taxes owing and paid. Since the general accounts are discussed elsewhere in this part of the book and are not tax-specific, they will not be detailed in this section.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can attach zero or more <code>Purchase Taxes<\\/code> and <code>Sale Taxes<\\/code> items to products, so that you can account separately for purchase and sales taxes (or Input and Output VAT \\u2013 where VAT is Value Added Tax). Because you can attach more than one tax, you can handle a VAT or Sales Tax separately from an Eco Tax on the same product.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To create a new Tax Code, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Tax Codes<\\/code>. You should define the following fields:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Tax Case Name<\\/code>: a unique name required to identify the tax case, usually taken from your VAT return.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Case Code<\\/code>: an optional short code for the case.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Parent Code<\\/code>: a link to a parent Tax Code to create a tree structure which can be displayed from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Chart of Taxes<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Not Printable in Invoice<\\/code>: a checkbox allowing you to indicate that any taxes linked to the tax code concerned should not be printed on the invoice.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Coefficient<\\/code> for parent: choose 1.00 to add the total to the parent account or -1.00 to subtract it.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Description<\\/code>: a free text field for documentation purposes.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_def_tax_code_form.png\\\" alt=\\\"account def tax code form\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Tax Code<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also see two read-only fields:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Period Sum<\\/code>: a single figure showing the total accumulated on this case for the current financial period.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Year Sum<\\/code>: a single figure showing the total accumulated on this case for the financial year.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You will probably need to create two tax codes for each different tax rate that you have to define, one for the tax itself and one for the invoice amount (the so-called base code) the tax is computed from.

This principle can easily be used when posting purchase invoices for which no products are required.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Taxes on Products and Accounts will usually be national taxes. Odoo is capable of automatically converting national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes through the concept of Fiscal Positions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Fiscal Positions<\\/code>. You can use the fiscal positions to automatically convert national taxes to the required intracommunal or export taxes, according to the fiscal position specified for the customer or supplier.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Fiscal positions allow you to make a mapping from national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes, or to map your accounts according to these criteria.

When you select a journal type, some configuration parameters will be preset. The journal type will tell the system where the journal concerned can be used.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Each journal has a specific way of displaying data. The type of journal determines the journal view, which indicates the fields that need to be visible and are required to enter accounting data in that journal. The view determines both the order of the fields and the properties of each field. For example, the field Statement has to appear when entering data in the bank journal, but not in the other journals.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also create your own journal views. However, before creating a new view for a journal, check whether there is nothing similar already defined. You should only create a new view for new types of journals.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can create a sequence for each journal. This sequence determines the automatic numbering for accounting entries. Several journals can use the same sequence if you want to define one for them all, and if your legislation allows this.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Sequences can also be created from the <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Sequences &amp; Identifiers &gt; Sequences<\\/code>. By default, Odoo has only one sequence in the journal definition. If you need two separate sequences to be kept for the journal, you can install the module account_sequence.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The default credit and debit account allow the software to automatically generate counterpart entries when you are entering data through <code>Journal Items<\\/code>. In some journals, debit and credit accounts are mandatory. For example, in a bank journal you should put an associated bank account, so that you do not have to create counterparts for each transaction manually.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A journal can be marked as being centralised. When you do this, the counterpart entries will not be owned by each entry, but will be global for the given journal and period. You will then have a credit line and a debit line centralized for each entry in one of these journals, meaning that both credit and debit appear on the same line. This option is used when posting opening entries in a situation journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A bank journal can automatically be created from the bank account(s) you define for your company. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Setup your Bank Accounts<\\/code>. Here you create the bank account or IBAN number of your company\'s bank account(s). Fill in the <code>Bank Name<\\/code>, and when you save the entry, your <code>Bank Journal<\\/code> will automatically be created with the <code>Bank Name<\\/code> and the <code>Account Number<\\/code>. The general ledger account for this bank will also be created for you.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Controls and Tips for Data Entry<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>You can have control on journals in Odoo \\u2013 controls over the accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To avoid entering account data in wrong accounts, you can put conditions on the general accounts about which journal can use a given account. To do this, you have to list all the accounts or valid account types in the second tab, Entry Controls. If you have not added any accounts there, Odoo applies no restriction on the accounts for that journal. If you list accounts and\\/or the types of accounts that can be used in a journal, Odoo prevents you from using any account or account type not in that list. This verification step starts from the moment you enter data. You can only select allowed accounts or account types.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This functionality is useful for limiting possible data entry errors by restricting the accounts to be used in a journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>Control of Data Entry<\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>In accounting it is not a good idea to allow a data entry directly from bank account A to bank account B. If you enter a transaction from bank A to bank B, the transaction will be accounted for twice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To prevent this problem, pass the transaction through intermediate account C. At the time of data entry, the system checks the type of account that is accepted in the bank journal: only accounts that are not of type <code>Bank<\\/code> are accepted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If your accountant defines this control properly, non-accounting users are prevented from transferring payments from one bank to<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"paymentterm\\\">Payment Terms<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>You can define whatever payment terms you need in Odoo. Payment terms determine the due dates for paying an invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To define new payment terms, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Payment Terms<\\/code> and then click Create.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The figure below represents the following payment term: 5000 within 5 days, 50% payment at the last day of current month, Remaining on 15th of next month.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_payment_term.png\\\" alt=\\\"account payment term\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Configuring payment terms<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To configure new conditions, start by giving a name to the <code>Payment Term<\\/code> field.

The delay Day of the Month can be set to <code>-1<\\/code> , <code>0<\\/code> or any positive number. For example, if today is 20th December 2012, and if you want to set payment terms like this:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>5000 within 5 days<\\/code>: set Valuation Fixed Amount, Number of Days 5 and Day of the Month 0.

To create the different analytic accounts, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Analytic Accounting &gt; Analytic Accounts<\\/code> and click the Create button. Note that the data you see when creating an analytic account will depend upon the business applications installed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_analytic_form.png\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Setting up an Analytic Account<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To create an analytic account, you have to complete the main fields:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The <code>Account Name<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The <code>Reference<\\/code>: used as a shortcut for selecting the account.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The <code>Account Type<\\/code>: just like general accounts, the Analytic View type is used for virtual accounts which are used only to create a hierarchical structure and for subtotals, and not to store accounting entries. The Analytic Account type will be used for usual accounts that you only want to use in accounting. If you select Contract or Project, it offers you the possibility to manage the validity and the invoicing options for this account. The special type Template of Project allows you to define a template with default data that you can reuse easily.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The <code>Parent Analytic Account<\\/code>: use this field to define the hierarchy between the accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>If an analytic account (e.g. a project) is for a limited time, you can define a start and end date here.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The <code>Maximum Time<\\/code> can be used for contracts with a fixed limit of hours to use.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You have several methods available to you in Odoo for automated invoicing:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Service companies usually use invoicing from purchase orders, analytic accounts or project management tasks.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Manufacturing and trading companies more often use invoicing from deliveries or customer purchase orders.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>For more information about invoicing from projects, we refer to the book (soon to be released) about Project and Services Management.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Once you have defined the different analytic accounts, you can view your chart through the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Chart of Analytic Accounts<\\/code>. You can display analytic accounts for one or more periods or for an entire financial year.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_analytic_chart.png\\\" alt=\\\"account analytic chart\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Analytic Chart of Accounts<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>Setting up an Analytic Account<\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>The setup screen for an analytic account can vary according to the modules installed in your database. For example, you will see information about recharging services only if you have the module <code>hr_timesheet_invoice<\\/code> installed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Some of these modules add helpful management statistics to the analytic account. The most useful is probably the module <code>account_analytic_analysis<\\/code>, which adds such information as indicators about your margins, invoicing amounts, and latest service dates and invoice dates.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Creating Journals<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Once the analytic chart has been created for your company, you have to create the different journals. These journals enable you to categorise the different accounting entries by their type, such as:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Services.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Expense reimbursements.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Purchases of materials.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Miscellaneous expenditure.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Sales.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>At a minimum, you have to create one analytic journal for Sales and one for Purchases. If you do not create these two, Odoo will not validate invoices linked to an analytic account, because it would not be able to create an analytic accounting entry automatically.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_analytic_journal.png\\\" alt=\\\"account analytic journal\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Creating an Analytic Journal<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To define your analytic journals, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Analytic Accounting &gt; Analytic Journals<\\/code> then click the Create button.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is easy to create an analytic journal. Just give it a <code>Journal Name<\\/code>, a <code>Journal Code<\\/code> and a <code>Type<\\/code>. The types available are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Sale, for sales to customers and for credit notes.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Purchase, for purchases and expenses.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Cash, for financial entries.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Situation, to adjust accounts when starting an activity, or at the end of the financial year.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>General, for all other entries.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The analytic journal now has to be linked to your general journals to allow Odoo to post the analytic entries. For example, if you enter an invoice for a customer, Odoo will automatically search for the analytic journal of type Saleslinked to your Sales Journal. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals<\\/code> and select for instance the Sales journal.

Unfortunately, that structure does not always correspond to the view that a company needs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In Odoo, you can use the concept of virtual charts of accounts to manage several representations of the same accounts simultaneously. These representations can be shown in real time with no additional data entry.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So your general chart of accounts can be the one imposed by the statutes of your country, and your CEO can then have other virtual charts as necessary, based on the accounts in the general chart. For example, you can create a view per department, a cash-flow and liquidity view, or consolidated accounts for different companies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The most interesting thing about virtual charts of accounts is that they can be used in the same way as the default chart of accounts for the whole organization. For example, you can establish budgets from your consolidated accounts or the accounts from one of your companies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Virtual accounts enable you to provide different representations of one or several existing charts of accounts. Creating and restructuring virtual accounts has no impact on the accounting entries. You can then use the virtual charts with no risk of altering the general chart of accounts or future accounting entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Because they are used only to get a different representation of the same entries, they are very useful for:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Consolidating several companies in real time.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Reporting to a holding according to their chart of accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Depreciation calculations.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Cash-flow views.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Getting more useful views than those imposed.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Presenting summary charts to other users that are appropriate to their general system rights.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>So there are good reasons for viewing the impact of financial transactions through virtual charts, such as budgets and financial indicators based on special views of the company.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To create a new chart of accounts you should create a root account using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Accounts<\\/code>. Your top level account should have a name, a code (different from any other code in your current chart), an <code>Internal Type<\\/code> and <code>Account Type View<\\/code>. Then you can choose your structure by creating other accounts of Account Type View as necessary. The <code>Internal Type<\\/code> should be of the Consolidation type if you want to map accounts. Check your virtual structure using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Charts of Accounts<\\/code> and select the corresponding chart in the drop-down list at the top of the screen.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To be able to map your virtual chart of accounts to your general chart of accounts, you have to set Internal Type as <code>Consolidation<\\/code>. From the Consolidated Children you can then map accounts or make accounts consolidate. In the <code>Consolidated Children<\\/code>, you can add <code>View<\\/code> accounts or normal accounts. If you add a View account to the consolidated children, Odoo will automatically include all existing and future linked accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_virtual.png\\\" alt=\\\"account virtual\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Virtual Accounts Mapped to View Account<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can then run reports such as <code>Trial Balance<\\/code> and <code>General Ledger<\\/code> for both your general chart of accounts and your virtual chart(s) giving you another representation of the company.

Since the general accounts are discussed elsewhere in this part of the book and are not tax-specific, they will not be detailed in this section.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can attach zero or more <code>Purchase Taxes<\\/code> and <code>Sale Taxes<\\/code> items to products, so that you can account separately for purchase and sales taxes (or Input and Output VAT \\u2013 where VAT is Value Added Tax). Because you can attach more than one tax, you can handle a VAT or Sales Tax separately from an Eco Tax on the same product.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To create a new Tax Code, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Tax Codes<\\/code>.

This principle can easily be used when posting purchase invoices for which no products are required.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Taxes on Products and Accounts will usually be national taxes. Odoo is capable of automatically converting national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes through the concept of Fiscal Positions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Fiscal Positions<\\/code>. You can use the fiscal positions to automatically convert national taxes to the required intracommunal or export taxes, according to the fiscal position specified for the customer or supplier.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Fiscal positions allow you to make a mapping from national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes, or to map your accounts according to these criteria.

When you select a journal type, some configuration parameters will be preset. The journal type will tell the system where the journal concerned can be used.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Each journal has a specific way of displaying data. The type of journal determines the journal view, which indicates the fields that need to be visible and are required to enter accounting data in that journal. The view determines both the order of the fields and the properties of each field. For example, the field Statement has to appear when entering data in the bank journal, but not in the other journals.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also create your own journal views. However, before creating a new view for a journal, check whether there is nothing similar already defined. You should only create a new view for new types of journals.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can create a sequence for each journal. This sequence determines the automatic numbering for accounting entries. Several journals can use the same sequence if you want to define one for them all, and if your legislation allows this.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Sequences can also be created from the <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Sequences &amp; Identifiers &gt; Sequences<\\/code>. By default, Odoo has only one sequence in the journal definition. If you need two separate sequences to be kept for the journal, you can install the module account_sequence.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The default credit and debit account allow the software to automatically generate counterpart entries when you are entering data through <code>Journal Items<\\/code>. In some journals, debit and credit accounts are mandatory. For example, in a bank journal you should put an associated bank account, so that you do not have to create counterparts for each transaction manually.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A journal can be marked as being centralised. When you do this, the counterpart entries will not be owned by each entry, but will be global for the given journal and period. You will then have a credit line and a debit line centralized for each entry in one of these journals, meaning that both credit and debit appear on the same line. This option is used when posting opening entries in a situation journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A bank journal can automatically be created from the bank account(s) you define for your company. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Setup your Bank Accounts<\\/code>. Here you create the bank account or IBAN number of your company\'s bank account(s). Fill in the <code>Bank Name<\\/code>, and when you save the entry, your <code>Bank Journal<\\/code> will automatically be created with the <code>Bank Name<\\/code> and the <code>Account Number<\\/code>. The general ledger account for this bank will also be created for you.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Controls and Tips for Data Entry<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>You can have control on journals in Odoo \\u2013 controls over the accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To avoid entering account data in wrong accounts, you can put conditions on the general accounts about which journal can use a given account. To do this, you have to list all the accounts or valid account types in the second tab, Entry Controls. If you have not added any accounts there, Odoo applies no restriction on the accounts for that journal. If you list accounts and\\/or the types of accounts that can be used in a journal, Odoo prevents you from using any account or account type not in that list. This verification step starts from the moment you enter data. You can only select allowed accounts or account types.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This functionality is useful for limiting possible data entry errors by restricting the accounts to be used in a journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>Control of Data Entry<\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>In accounting it is not a good idea to allow a data entry directly from bank account A to bank account B. If you enter a transaction from bank A to bank B, the transaction will be accounted for twice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To prevent this problem, pass the transaction through intermediate account C. At the time of data entry, the system checks the type of account that is accepted in the bank journal: only accounts that are not of type <code>Bank<\\/code> are accepted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If your accountant defines this control properly, non-accounting users are prevented from transferring payments from one bank to<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"paymentterm\\\">Payment Terms<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>You can define whatever payment terms you need in Odoo.

The most useful is probably the module <code>account_analytic_analysis<\\/code>, which adds such information as indicators about your margins, invoicing amounts, and latest service dates and invoice dates.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Creating Journals<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Once the analytic chart has been created for your company, you have to create the different journals. These journals enable you to categorise the different accounting entries by their type, such as:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Services.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Expense reimbursements.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Purchases of materials.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Miscellaneous expenditure.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Sales.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>At a minimum, you have to create one analytic journal for Sales and one for Purchases. If you do not create these two, Odoo will not validate invoices linked to an analytic account, because it would not be able to create an analytic accounting entry automatically.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_analytic_journal.png\\\" alt=\\\"account analytic journal\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Creating an Analytic Journal<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To define your analytic journals, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Analytic Accounting &gt; Analytic Journals<\\/code> then click the Create button.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is easy to create an analytic journal. Just give it a <code>Journal Name<\\/code>, a <code>Journal Code<\\/code> and a <code>Type<\\/code>. The types available are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Sale, for sales to customers and for credit notes.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Purchase, for purchases and expenses.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Cash, for financial entries.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Situation, to adjust accounts when starting an activity, or at the end of the financial year.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>General, for all other entries.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The analytic journal now has to be linked to your general journals to allow Odoo to post the analytic entries. For example, if you enter an invoice for a customer, Odoo will automatically search for the analytic journal of type Saleslinked to your Sales Journal. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals<\\/code> and select for instance the Sales journal. In the Analytic Journal select the analytic sales journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_general_journal.png\\\" alt=\\\"account general journal\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Linking an Analytic Journal to a Journal<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Working with Analytic Defaults<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>You can work with analytic default accounts in Odoo by installing the <code>account_analytic_default<\\/code> module. Notice that this module is also linked with the sale, stock and procurement modules.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The system will automatically select analytic accounts according to the following criteria:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Product.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Partner.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>User.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Company.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Date.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can configure these criteria using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Analytic Accounting &gt; Analytic Defaults<\\/code> and clicking the Create button.

Example: create a profit &amp; loss report (view) including costs (account class 6) and income (account class 7). In the Balance Sheet, define a report <code>Profit&amp;Loss Balance<\\/code>, with Balance Sheet as the Parent. Set the type to Report Value and link it to the P&amp;L view report you defined.

That is what you will use Budgetary Positions for, from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Budgets &gt; Budgetary Positions<\\/code>. Here you can select the general accounts for which you want to keep budgets. The aim is to group general accounts logically, according to sales or purchases, for instance.

This lets you analyse your changing perspectives of the company from revision to revision.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To define your budgets, start by entering a <code>Name<\\/code>, a <code>Code<\\/code>, a <code>Duration<\\/code> for your new budget. Then you can define the budgeted amounts for each analytic account within a specified period, one by one (enter negative amounts for purchases, positive amounts for sales).

The <code>End Date<\\/code> selected in the wizard determines how the theoretical amount will be calculated; if you select the last day of your financial year, the theoretical amount will be calculated as a function of that date (thus considering a complete financial year).

When selecting individual accounts, you need to specifically add each newly created account to get the correct report.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Account Type<\\/code>: selecting an account type means that all accounts related to the selected account type(s) will be printed on the report.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Report Value<\\/code>: thanks to this value you can include the balance of existing reports in another report. Example: create a profit &amp; loss report (view) including costs (account class 6) and income (account class 7). In the Balance Sheet, define a report <code>Profit&amp;Loss Balance<\\/code>, with Balance Sheet as the Parent. Set the type to Report Value and link it to the P&amp;L view report you defined.

This lets you analyse your changing perspectives of the company from revision to revision.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To define your budgets, start by entering a <code>Name<\\/code>, a <code>Code<\\/code>, a <code>Duration<\\/code> for your new budget.

The <code>End Date<\\/code> selected in the wizard determines how the theoretical amount will be calculated; if you select the last day of your financial year, the theoretical amount will be calculated as a function of that date (thus considering a complete financial year).
