They are automatically generated by the following operations:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Confirmation of an invoice generates analytic entries for sales or purchases connected to the account shown in the invoice line.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The entry of a service generates an analytic entry for the cost of this service to the given project.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The manufacturing of a product generates an entry for the manufacturing cost of each operation in the product range.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Other documents linked to one of these three operations produce analytic records indirectly. For example, when you are entering a customer sales order, you can link it to the customer\'s analytic account. When you are managing by case or project, mark the project with that order. This order will then generate a customer invoice, which will be linked to the analytic account. When the invoice is validated, it will automatically create general and analytic accounting records for the corresponding project.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Expense receipts from an employee can be linked to an analytic account for reimbursement. When a receipt is approved by the company, a purchase invoice is created. This invoice represents a debit on the company in favour of the employee. Each line of the purchase invoice is then linked to an analytic account which automatically allocates the costs for that receipt to the corresponding project.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To visualise the general entries following these different actions, you can use one of the following menus:<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote><ol>\\r\\n<li>To see all of the entries, <code>Accounting &gt; Journal Entries &gt; Analytic Journal Items\\/code&gt;.<\\/code><\\/li>\\r\\n<li>To see the entries per account, per user, per product or per partner, you can use the menu <code>Reporting &gt; Accounting &gt; Analytic Entries Analysis<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_analytic_analysis2.png\\\" alt=\\\"account analytic analysis2\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Analytic Entries Analysis<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"modes\\\">Analytic Models<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Standard Odoo allows you to post analytic entries to one chart at a time.

So you can enter various different analytic operations that have no counterpart in the general financial accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>While the structure of the general chart of accounts is imposed by law, the analytic chart of accounts is built to fit a company\'s needs closely.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Just as in the general accounts, you will find accounting entries in the different analytic accounts. Each analytic entry can be linked to a general account, or not, as you wish. Conversely, an entry in a general account can be linked to one, several, or no corresponding analytic accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You will discover many advantages of this independent representation below. For the more impatient, here are some of those advantages:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>You can manage many different analytic operations.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>You can modify an analytic plan on the fly, during the course of an activity, because of its independence.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>You can avoid an explosion in the number of general accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Even those companies that do not use Odoo\'s general accounts can use the analytic accounts for management.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Unlike general accounts, analytic accounts in Odoo are not so much an accounting tool for Accounts as a management tool for everyone in the company. (That is why they are also called management accounts.)<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The main users of analytic accounts should be the directors, general managers and project managers. Analytic accounts make up a powerful tool that can be used in different ways. The trick is to create your own analytic structure for a chart of accounts that closely matches your company\'s needs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To illustrate analytic accounts clearly, you will follow three use cases, each in one of three different types of company:<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote><ol>\\r\\n<li>Industrial Manufacturing Enterprise.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Law Firm.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>IT Services Company.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"case1\\\">Case 1: Industrial Manufacturing Enterprise<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>In industry, you will often find analytic charts of accounts structured into departments and products the company itself is built on.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So the objective is to examine the costs, sales and margins by department and by product. The first level of the structure comprises the different departments, and the lower levels represent the product ranges the company makes and sells.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Analytic Chart of Accounts for an Industrial Manufacturing Company<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Marketing Department.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Commercial Department.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Administration Department.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Production.\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Product Range 1<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Sub-groups<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Product Range 2<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n<p>In daily use, it is useful to mark the analytic account on each purchase invoice. The analytic account is the one to which the costs of that purchase should be allocated. When the invoice is approved, it will automatically generate the entries for both the general and the corresponding analytic accounts. So, for each entry on the general accounts, there is at least one analytic entry that allocates costs to the department which incurred them.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Here is a possible breakdown of some general

All of the expenses and products are then attached to a given file.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A principal preoccupation of law firms is the invoicing of hours worked, and the profitability by case and by employee.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Mechanisms used for encoding the hours worked will be covered in detail in Human Resources. Like most system processes, hours worked are integrated into the analytic accounting. Every time an employee enters a timesheet for a number of hours, that automatically generates analytic accounts corresponding to the cost of those hours in the case concerned. The hourly charge is a function of the employee\'s salary.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So a law firm will opt for an analytic representation which reflects the management of the time that employees work on the different client cases.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><code>Example Representation of an Analytic Chart of Accounts for a Law Firm<\\/code><\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Absences\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Paid Absences<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Unpaid Absences<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Internal Projects\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Administrative<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Others<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Client Cases\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Client 1\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Case 1.1<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Case 1.2<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Client 2\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Client 2.1<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n<p>All expenses and sales are then attached to a case. This gives the profitability of each case and, at a consolidated level, of each client.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Billing for the different cases is a bit unusual. The cases do not match any entry in the general account nor do they come from purchase or sales invoices. They are represented by the various analytic operations and do not have exact counterparts in the general accounts. They are calculated on the basis of the hourly cost per employee. These entries are automatically created when billing worksheets.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>At the end of the month when you pay salaries and benefits, you integrate them into the general accounts but not in the analytic accounts, because they have already been accounted for in billing each account. A report that relates data from the analytic and general accounts then lets you compare the totals, so you can readjust your estimates of hourly cost per employee depending on the time actually worked.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The following table shows an example of different analytic entries that you can find for your analytic account:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<table class=\\\"table\\\"><caption>Analytic

various transactions. In this example, the cost of Case 1.1 is 95.00 (the sum of the analytic costs of studying the files, searching for information and fuel costs), but has been invoiced at 280.00, which gives you a gross profit of 185.00.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>But an interest in analytical accounts is not limited to a simple analysis of the profitability of different cases.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The same data can be used for automatic recharging of the services to the client at the end of the month. To invoice clients, just take the analytic costs in that month and apply a selling price factor to generate the invoice. Invoicing mechanisms for this are explained in greater detail in Services &amp; Project Management. If the client requires details of the services used on the case, you can print the service entries in the analytic account for this case.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Most software that manages billing enables you to recharge hours worked. In Odoo, these services are automatically represented by analytic costs. But many other Odoo documents can also generate analytic costs, such as credit notes and purchases of goods.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So when you invoice the client at the end of the month, it is possible for you to include all the analytic costs, and not just the hours worked. So, for example, you can easily recharge the whole cost of your journeys to the client.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"case3\\\">Case 3: IT Services Company<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Most IT service companies face the following problems:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Project planning.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Invoicing, profitability and financial follow-up of projects.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Managing support contracts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>To deal with these problems, you would use an analytic chart of accounts structured by project and by contract. A representation of that is given in the following example:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><code>Example Analytic Representation of a Chart of Accounts for an IT Services Company<\\/code><\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Internal Projects\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Administrative and Commercial.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Research and Development.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Client Projects\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Client 1\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Project 1.1<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Project 1.2<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Client 2\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Project 2.1<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Project 2.2<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Support Contracts \\u2013 20h\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Customer X<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Customer Y<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n<p>The management of services, expenditures and sales is similar to that presented above for lawyers. Invoicing and the study of profitability are also similar.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>But now look at support contracts. These contracts are usually limited to a prepaid number of hours. Each service posted in the analytic accounts shows the remaining hours of support. To manage support contracts, you would use the quantities and not the amounts in the analytic entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In Odoo, each analytic line lists the number of units sold or used, as well as what you would usually find there \\u2013 the amount in currency units (USD or GBP, or whatever other choice you make). So you can sum the quantities sold and used on each analytic account to determine whether any hours of the support contract remain.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To differentiate services from other costs in the analytic account, you use the concept of the analytic journal. Analytic entries are then allocated into the different journals:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Service journal.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Expense journal.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Sales journal.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Purchase journal.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>To obtain the detailed breakdown of a support contract, you only have to look at the service journal for the analytic account corresponding to the contract in question.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Finally, the analytic account can be used to forecast future needs. For example, monthly planning of staff on different projects can be seen as an analytic budget limited to the service journal. Accounting entries are expressed in quantities (such as number of hours, and numbers of products), and in amounts in units of currency (USD or GBP for instance).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So you can set up planning on just the basis of quantities. Analysing the analytic budget enables you to compare the budget (that is, your plan) to the services actually carried out by month end.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Problems of cash management are amongst the main difficulties encountered by small growing businesses. It is really difficult to predict the amount of cash that will be available when a company is young and rapidly growing.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If the company adopts management by case, then staff planning can be represented in the analytic accounts report, as you have seen.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>But since you know your selling price for each of the different projects, you can see that it is easy to use the plan in the analytic accounts to more precisely forecast the amounts that you will invoice in the coming months.&nbsp;<\\/p>\",\"state\":1,\"catid\":\"27\",\"created\":\"2015-08-14 13:56:48\",\"created_by\":\"836\",\"created_by_alias\":\"\",\"modified\":\"2015-08-14 14:09:35\",\"modified_by\":\"836\",\"checked_out\":\"836\",\"checked_out_time\":\"2015-08-14 13:57:58\",\"publish_up\":\"2015-08-14 13:56:48\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":2,\"ordering\":\"10\",\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"Sitting at the heart of your company\'s processes, analytic accounts (or cost accounts) are indispensable tools for managing your operations well.

Click an account to drill down to its details.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Most accounting software packages represent their charts of accounts in the form of a list. You can do this in Odoo as well if you want to, but its tree view offers several advantages:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>It lets you show in detail only the accounts that interest you.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>It enables you to get a global view of accounts (when you show only summary accounts).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>It is more intuitive, because you can search for accounts on the basis of their classification.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>It is flexible because you can easily restructure them.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The structure of the chart of accounts is hierarchical, with account subtotals calculated from the <code>View<\\/code> accounts. You can develop a set of view accounts to contain only those elements that interest you.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To get the details of the account entries that are important to you, all you need to do is click the account\'s code or name.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Displaying the chart of accounts can take several seconds, because Odoo calculates the debits, credits and balance for each account in real time.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Virtual Charts of Accounts<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The structure of a chart of accounts is imposed by the legislation in effect in the country concerned. Unfortunately, that structure does not always correspond to the view that a company needs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In Odoo, you can use the concept of virtual charts of accounts to manage several representations of the same accounts simultaneously. These representations can be shown in real time with no additional data entry.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So your general chart of accounts can be the one imposed by the statutes of your country, and your CEO can then have other virtual charts as necessary, based on the accounts in the general chart. For example, you can create a view per department, a cash-flow and liquidity view, or consolidated accounts for different companies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The most interesting thing about virtual charts of accounts is that they can be used in the same way as the default chart of accounts for the whole organization. For example, you can establish budgets from your consolidated accounts or the accounts from one of your companies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Virtual accounts enable you to provide different representations of one or several existing charts of accounts. Creating and restructuring virtual accounts has no impact on the accounting entries. You can then use the virtual charts with no risk of altering the general chart of accounts or future accounting entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Because they are used only to get a different representation of the same entries, they are very useful for:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Consolidating several companies in real time.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Reporting to a holding according to their chart of accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Depreciation calculations.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Cash-flow views.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Getting more useful views than those imposed.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Presenting summary charts to other users that are appropriate to their general system rights.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>So there are good reasons for viewing the impact of financial transactions through virtual charts, such as budgets and financial indicators based on special views of the company.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To create a new chart of accounts you should create a root account using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Accounts<\\/code>. Your top level account should have a name, a code (different from any other code in your current chart), an <code>Internal Type<\\/code> and <code>Account Type View<\\/code>. Then you can choose your structure by creating other accounts of Account Type View as necessary. The <code>Internal Type<\\/code> should be of the Consolidation type if you want to map accounts. Check your virtual structure using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Charts of Accounts<\\/code> and select the corresponding chart in the drop-down list at the top of the screen.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To be able to map your virtual chart of accounts to your general chart of accounts, you have to set Internal Type as <code>Consolidation<\\/code>. From the Consolidated Children you can then map accounts or make accounts consolidate. In the <code>Consolidated Children<\\/code>, you can add <code>View<\\/code> accounts or normal accounts. If you add a View account to the consolidated children, Odoo will automatically include all existing and future linked accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_virtual.png\\\" alt=\\\"account virtual\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Virtual Accounts Mapped to View Account<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can then run reports such as <code>Trial Balance<\\/code> and <code>General Ledger<\\/code> for both your general chart of accounts and your virtual chart(s) giving you another representation of the company. All the actions and states in your general account are also available in the virtual accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Finally, you can also make virtual charts of accounts from other virtual charts.

Since the general accounts are discussed elsewhere in this part of the book and are not tax-specific, they will not be detailed in this section.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can attach zero or more <code>Purchase Taxes<\\/code> and <code>Sale Taxes<\\/code> items to products, so that you can account separately for purchase and sales taxes (or Input and Output VAT \\u2013 where VAT is Value Added Tax). Because you can attach more than one tax, you can handle a VAT or Sales Tax separately from an Eco Tax on the same product.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To create a new Tax Code, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Tax Codes<\\/code>.

This principle can easily be used when posting purchase invoices for which no products are required.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Taxes on Products and Accounts will usually be national taxes. Odoo is capable of automatically converting national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes through the concept of Fiscal Positions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Fiscal Positions<\\/code>. You can use the fiscal positions to automatically convert national taxes to the required intracommunal or export taxes, according to the fiscal position specified for the customer or supplier.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Fiscal positions allow you to make a mapping from national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes, or to map your accounts according to these criteria.

When you select a journal type, some configuration parameters will be preset. The journal type will tell the system where the journal concerned can be used.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Each journal has a specific way of displaying data. The type of journal determines the journal view, which indicates the fields that need to be visible and are required to enter accounting data in that journal. The view determines both the order of the fields and the properties of each field. For example, the field Statement has to appear when entering data in the bank journal, but not in the other journals.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also create your own journal views. However, before creating a new view for a journal, check whether there is nothing similar already defined. You should only create a new view for new types of journals.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can create a sequence for each journal. This sequence determines the automatic numbering for accounting entries. Several journals can use the same sequence if you want to define one for them all, and if your legislation allows this.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Sequences can also be created from the <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Sequences &amp; Identifiers &gt; Sequences<\\/code>. By default, Odoo has only one sequence in the journal definition. If you need two separate sequences to be kept for the journal, you can install the module account_sequence.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The default credit and debit account allow the software to automatically generate counterpart entries when you are entering data through <code>Journal Items<\\/code>. In some journals, debit and credit accounts are mandatory. For example, in a bank journal you should put an associated bank account, so that you do not have to create counterparts for each transaction manually.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A journal can be marked as being centralised. When you do this, the counterpart entries will not be owned by each entry, but will be global for the given journal and period. You will then have a credit line and a debit line centralized for each entry in one of these journals, meaning that both credit and debit appear on the same line. This option is used when posting opening entries in a situation journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A bank journal can automatically be created from the bank account(s) you define for your company. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Setup your Bank Accounts<\\/code>. Here you create the bank account or IBAN number of your company\'s bank account(s). Fill in the <code>Bank Name<\\/code>, and when you save the entry, your <code>Bank Journal<\\/code> will automatically be created with the <code>Bank Name<\\/code> and the <code>Account Number<\\/code>. The general ledger account for this bank will also be created for you.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Controls and Tips for Data Entry<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>You can have control on journals in Odoo \\u2013 controls over the accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To avoid entering account data in wrong accounts, you can put conditions on the general accounts about which journal can use a given account. To do this, you have to list all the accounts or valid account types in the second tab, Entry Controls. If you have not added any accounts there, Odoo applies no restriction on the accounts for that journal. If you list accounts and\\/or the types of accounts that can be used in a journal, Odoo prevents you from using any account or account type not in that list. This verification step starts from the moment you enter data. You can only select allowed accounts or account types.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This functionality is useful for limiting possible data entry errors by restricting the accounts to be used in a journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h4>Control of Data Entry<\\/h4>\\r\\n<p>In accounting it is not a good idea to allow a data entry directly from bank account A to bank account B. If you enter a transaction from bank A to bank B, the transaction will be accounted for twice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To prevent this problem, pass the transaction through intermediate account C. At the time of data entry, the system checks the type of account that is accepted in the bank journal: only accounts that are not of type <code>Bank<\\/code> are accepted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If your accountant defines this control properly, non-accounting users are prevented from transferring payments from one bank to<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"paymentterm\\\">Payment Terms<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>You can define whatever payment terms you need in Odoo.

These journals enable you to categorise the different accounting entries by their type, such as:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Services.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Expense reimbursements.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Purchases of materials.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Miscellaneous expenditure.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Sales.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>At a minimum, you have to create one analytic journal for Sales and one for Purchases. If you do not create these two, Odoo will not validate invoices linked to an analytic account, because it would not be able to create an analytic accounting entry automatically.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_analytic_journal.png\\\" alt=\\\"account analytic journal\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Creating an Analytic Journal<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To define your analytic journals, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Analytic Accounting &gt; Analytic Journals<\\/code> then click the Create button.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is easy to create an analytic journal. Just give it a <code>Journal Name<\\/code>, a <code>Journal Code<\\/code> and a <code>Type<\\/code>. The types available are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Sale, for sales to customers and for credit notes.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Purchase, for purchases and expenses.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Cash, for financial entries.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Situation, to adjust accounts when starting an activity, or at the end of the financial year.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>General, for all other entries.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The analytic journal now has to be linked to your general journals to allow Odoo to post the analytic entries. For example, if you enter an invoice for a customer, Odoo will automatically search for the analytic journal of type Saleslinked to your Sales Journal. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals<\\/code> and select for instance the Sales journal. In the Analytic Journal select the analytic sales journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_general_journal.png\\\" alt=\\\"account general journal\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Linking an Analytic Journal to a Journal<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Working with Analytic Defaults<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>You can work with analytic default accounts in Odoo by installing the <code>account_analytic_default<\\/code> module.

As soon as a statement is validated, the corresponding accounting entries are automatically generated by Odoo. So non-accounting people can enter financial transactions without having to worry about things such as credit, debit and counterparts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To enter a bank statement, go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Bank and Cash &gt; Bank Statements<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_statement.png\\\" alt=\\\"account statement\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Data Entry Form for a Bank Statement<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The statement reference <code>Name<\\/code> and the Date are automatically suggested by Odoo. The <code>Name<\\/code> will be filled with the statement number at confirmation of the bank statement. You can configure your own reference by managing sequences in the <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Sequences &amp; Identifiers &gt; Sequences<\\/code> menu.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Then select the correct Journal. Ideally, when you are configuring your company, you would create at least one journal for each bank account and one journal for petty cash in your company. So select the journal corresponding to the bank account whose statement you are handling.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The currency that you are using for the statement line is that of the selected journal. If you are entering statement lines for an account in American Dollars (USD), the amounts must be entered in USD . The currency is automatically converted into the company\'s main currency when you confirm the entry, using the rates in effect at the date of entry. (This means that you would need valid currency conversion rates to be created first. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Currencies<\\/code> menu.)<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo automatically completes the initial balance based on the closing balance of the preceding statement. You can modify this value and force another value. This lets you enter statements in the order of your choice. Also if you have lost a page of your statement, you can enter the following ones immediately and you are not forced to wait for a duplicate from the bank.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So, complete the closing balance which corresponds to the new value in the account displayed on your bank statement. This amount will be used to control the operations before approving the statement.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Then you must enter all the lines on the statement. Each line corresponds to a banking transaction.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Enter the transaction line. You have two ways of entering financial transactions: manually or through the Import Invoices button.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Manual Entry<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>When you type the Partner name, Odoo automatically proposes the corresponding centralisation account. The total amount due for the customer or supplier is pre-completed (<code>Amount<\\/code>). This gives you a simple indication of the effective payment. You must then enter the amount that appears on your statement line: a negative sign for a withdrawal and a positive sign for a cash payment or deposit.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Import Invoices<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Click the Import <code>Invoices<\\/code> button, then click <code>Add<\\/code> to select the invoices for which your payment will have to be reconciled.

If you see a difference between the payment and the invoices to reconcile, you can enter the difference in the second part of the form <code>Write-off<\\/code>. You have to set an account for the adjustment. The main reasons explaining the difference are usually:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Profit or Loss.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Exchange differences.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Discounts given for fast payment.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>When the reconciliation is complete - that is, the payment is equal to the sum of the due payments and the adjustments - you can close the reconciliation form.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The reconciliation operation is optional \\u2013 you could very well do it later or not do it at all. However, reconciliation has got two significant effects:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Marking that the invoices have been paid.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Preventing the payment and invoice amounts from appearing on customer reminder letters. Unless you have reconciled them, a customer will see the invoice and payment amounts on his reminder letter (which will not alter the balance due since they will just cancel each other out).<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Finally, once you have entered the complete bank statement, you can validate it. Odoo then automatically generates the corresponding accounting entries if the calculated balance equals the final balance, indicated in the <code>Closing Balance<\\/code> field. The reconciled invoices are marked as paid at that point.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also enter general accounting entries, for example, banking costs. In such cases, you can enter the amounts directly in the corresponding general accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A user with advanced accounting skills can enter accounting entries directly into the bank journal from <code>Accounting &gt; Journal Entries &gt; Journal Items<\\/code>. The result is the same, but the operation is more complex because you must know the accounts to use and must have mastered the ideas of credit and debit.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"cash\\\">Cash Management<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>To manage cash, you can use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Bank and Cash &gt; Cash Registers<\\/code>. At the start of the day you set the opening amount of cash in the entry (Opening Balance). Then click on button <code>Open CashBox<\\/code>, after you can start making entries from the <code>Cash Transactions<\\/code> tab.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You have to go menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals<\\/code> and open the cash journal , then go to the <code>Cash Register<\\/code> tab of form and select option Opening With Last Losing Balance and <code>Cash<\\/code> Control.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Because if you do not select that options , than you will find <code>Opening Cash Control<\\/code> field 0.00 of Cash Register form. So first you have to configure Journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_cash_registers.png\\\" alt=\\\"account cash registers\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Defining the Cash Register<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>All the transactions throughout the day are then entered in this statement. When you close the cashbox, generally at the end of the day, enter the amounts on the <code>Cash Control<\\/code> tab, in the Closing Balance section. Then confirm the statement to close the day\'s cash statement and automatically generate the corresponding accounting entries. Note that the <code>Calculated Balance<\\/code> and the <code>CashBox Balance<\\/code> need to be equal before you can close the cashbox.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Accounting entries are only generated when the cash statement is confirmed. So if the total statement has not been approved (that is to say during the day, in the case of petty cash), partner payments will not have been deducted from their corresponding account.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"manualentry\\\">Manual Entry in a Journal<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Invoices and statements produce accounting entries in different journals. But you could also create entries directly in a journal (line by line) without using the dedicated journal views. This functionality is often used for miscellaneous entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To make manual entries, go to the following menu <code>Accounting &gt; Journal Entries &gt; Journal Items<\\/code>. In the Journal field from the filter, select the journal in which you want to post. When you select a journal in this filter, you do not have to fill in the journal when posting new entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Let us give the example of a purchase invoice. Note, however, that these entries are usually generated automatically by Odoo.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Click the Create button. Fill these fields manually in the following order:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Reference<\\/code>: reference from the invoice or entry.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Effective date<\\/code>: effective date of the entry, will be preset with today\'s date.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Period<\\/code>: financial period, will be preset with the current period.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Partner<\\/code>: partner concerned.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Account<\\/code>: general account (e.g. purchase account Products Purchase).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Name<\\/code>: description of the invoice line (e.g. PC2).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Debit<\\/code>: here you type the debit amount.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Journal<\\/code>: here you select the journal in which you want to post.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Credit<\\/code>: here you type the credit amount, e.g. 1196.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Press the <code>Enter<\\/code> key on your keyboard to validate the first line. The next draft move number is assigned to your accounting entry. Your line is then colored red and takes the <code>Unbalanced<\\/code> state. When a line is in the draft state, it is not yet reflected in the accounts. Odoo will not validate that line until the balancing entry is made (so the credit amounts must balance the debit amounts for that set of entries).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo now proposes the balancing accounting line to be filled in. If the account used (in this case account 600000) includes taxes by default Odoo automatically proposes taxes associated with the amount entered. At this stage you can modify and validate this second line of the account, or replace it with other information such as a second purchase line.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you have entered all of the data from your lines, Odoo automatically proposes counterpart entries to you, based on the credit entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When an accounting entry is matched, Odoo moves it to the <code>Valid<\\/code> state automatically and prepares to enter the next data. Do not forget to definitely post the valid entries by clicking the Action button and selecting <code>Post Journal Entries<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you want to add some other balancing lines you can enter the number of the entry on the new line that you are entering. In such a case the whole line stays Draft until the whole set balances to zero.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"reconciliation\\\">Reconciliation Process<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>The reconciliation operation consists of matching entries in different accounts to indicate that they are related. Generally reconciliation is used for:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Matching invoice entries to payments, so that invoices are marked as paid and customers do not get payment reminder letters for those entries (reconciliation in a customer account).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Matching deposits and cheque withdrawals with their respective payments.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Matching invoices and credit notes to cancel them out.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>A reconciliation must be carried out on a list of accounting entries by an accountant, so that the sum of credits equals the sum of the debits for the matched entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reconciliation in Odoo can only be carried out in accounts that have been configured as reconcilable (the <code>Reconcile<\\/code> field).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Do not confuse account reconciliation and bank statement reconciliation<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is important not to confuse the reconciliation of accounting entries with bank statement reconciliation. Account reconciliation consists of linking account entries with each other, while statement reconciliation consists of verifying that your bank statement corresponds to the entries of that account in your accounting system.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>There are different methods of reconciling entries. You have already seen the reconciliation of entries while doing data entry in an account. Automatic and manual reconciliations are described here.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Automatic Reconciliation<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>For automatic reconciliation, you will be asking Odoo to search for entries to reconcile in a series of accounts. Odoo tries to find entries for each partner where the amounts correspond.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Depending on the level of complexity that you choose (= power) when you start running the tool, the software could reconcile from two to nine entries at the same time. For example, if you select level 5, Odoo will reconcile, for instance, three invoices and two payments if the total amounts correspond. Note that you can also choose a maximum write-off amount, if you allow payment differences to be posted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_reconcile_auto.png\\\" alt=\\\"account reconcile auto\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Form for Automatic Reconciliation<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To start the reconciliation tool, click <code>Accounting &gt; Periodical Processing &gt; Reconciliation &gt; Automatic Reconciliation<\\/code>. A form opens, asking you for the following information:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Add <code>Accounts to Reconcile<\\/code>: you can select one, several or all reconcilable accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The Reconciliation <code>Power<\\/code> (from 2 to 4).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Checkbox <code>Allow write<\\/code> off to determine whether you will allow for payment differences.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Information needed for the adjustment (details for the <code>Write-Off Move<\\/code>).<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can reconcile any account, but the most common accounts are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>All the Accounts Receivable \\u2013 your customer accounts of type Debtor.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>All the Accounts Payable \\u2013 your supplier accounts of type Creditor.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The write-off option enables you to reconcile entries even if their amounts are not exactly equivalent. For example, Odoo permits foreign customers whose accounts are in different currencies to have a difference of up to, say, 0.50 units of currency and put the difference in a write- off account.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You should not make the adjustment limits too large. Companies that introduced substantial automatic write-off adjustments have found that all employee expense reimbursements below the limit were written off automatically!<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\",\"state\":1,\"catid\":\"27\",\"created\":\"2015-08-13 12:10:23\",\"created_by\":\"836\",\"created_by_alias\":\"\",\"modified\":\"2015-08-15 00:34:35\",\"modified_by\":\"836\",\"checked_out\":\"836\",\"checked_out_time\":\"2015-08-15 00:23:18\",\"publish_up\":\"2015-08-13 12:10:23\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":12,\"ordering\":\"4\",\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"This section deals with: managing bank statements, managing cash, manual journal entries.\",\"access\":\"1\",\"hits\":\"8\",\"metadata\":\"{\\\"robots\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"rights\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"xreference\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"featured\":\"0\",\"language\":\"en-GB\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0'), ('886', '94', '1', '', '2015-08-15 00:38:36', '836', '20920', '06fe9c9a0ff7ce7f77236893b8683f4f9be3c439', '{\"id\":94,\"asset_id\":\"265\",\"title\":\"Accounting Entries\",\"alias\":\"accounting-entries\",\"introtext\":\"<p>Various methods can be used to create accounting entries.

Unless you have reconciled them, a customer will see the invoice and payment amounts on his reminder letter (which will not alter the balance due since they will just cancel each other out).<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Finally, once you have entered the complete bank statement, you can validate it. Odoo then automatically generates the corresponding accounting entries if the calculated balance equals the final balance, indicated in the <code>Closing Balance<\\/code> field. The reconciled invoices are marked as paid at that point.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also enter general accounting entries, for example, banking costs. In such cases, you can enter the amounts directly in the corresponding general accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A user with advanced accounting skills can enter accounting entries directly into the bank journal from <code>Accounting &gt; Journal Entries &gt; Journal Items<\\/code>. The result is the same, but the operation is more complex because you must know the accounts to use and must have mastered the ideas of credit and debit.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"cash\\\">Cash Management<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>To manage cash, you can use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Bank and Cash &gt; Cash Registers<\\/code>. At the start of the day you set the opening amount of cash in the entry (Opening Balance). Then click on button <code>Open CashBox<\\/code>, after you can start making entries from the <code>Cash Transactions<\\/code> tab.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You have to go menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals<\\/code> and open the cash journal , then go to the <code>Cash Register<\\/code> tab of form and select option Opening With Last Losing Balance and <code>Cash<\\/code> Control.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Because if you do not select that options , than you will find <code>Opening Cash Control<\\/code> field 0.00 of Cash Register form. So first you have to configure Journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_cash_registers.png\\\" alt=\\\"account cash registers\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Defining the Cash Register<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>All the transactions throughout the day are then entered in this statement. When you close the cashbox, generally at the end of the day, enter the amounts on the <code>Cash Control<\\/code> tab, in the Closing Balance section. Then confirm the statement to close the day\'s cash statement and automatically generate the corresponding accounting entries. Note that the <code>Calculated Balance<\\/code> and the <code>CashBox Balance<\\/code> need to be equal before you can close the cashbox.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Accounting entries are only generated when the cash statement is confirmed. So if the total statement has not been approved (that is to say during the day, in the case of petty cash), partner payments will not have been deducted from their corresponding account.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"manualentry\\\">Manual Entry in a Journal<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Invoices and statements produce accounting entries in different journals. But you could also create entries directly in a journal (line by line) without using the dedicated journal views. This functionality is often used for miscellaneous entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To make manual entries, go to the following menu <code>Accounting &gt; Journal Entries &gt; Journal Items<\\/code>. In the Journal field from the filter, select the journal in which you want to post. When you select a journal in this filter, you do not have to fill in the journal when posting new entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Let us give the example of a purchase invoice. Note, however, that these entries are usually generated automatically by Odoo.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Click the Create button. Fill these fields manually in the following order:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Reference<\\/code>: reference from the invoice or entry.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Effective date<\\/code>: effective date of the entry, will be preset with today\'s date.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Period<\\/code>: financial period, will be preset with the current period.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Partner<\\/code>: partner concerned.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Account<\\/code>: general account (e.g. purchase account Products Purchase).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Name<\\/code>: description of the invoice line (e.g. PC2).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Debit<\\/code>: here you type the debit amount.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Journal<\\/code>: here you select the journal in which you want to post.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Credit<\\/code>: here you type the credit amount, e.g. 1196.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Press the <code>Enter<\\/code> key on your keyboard to validate the first line. The next draft move number is assigned to your accounting entry. Your line is then colored red and takes the <code>Unbalanced<\\/code> state. When a line is in the draft state, it is not yet reflected in the accounts. Odoo will not validate that line until the balancing entry is made (so the credit amounts must balance the debit amounts for that set of entries).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo now proposes the balancing accounting line to be filled in. If the account used (in this case account 600000) includes taxes by default Odoo automatically proposes taxes associated with the amount entered. At this stage you can modify and validate this second line of the account, or replace it with other information such as a second purchase line.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you have entered all of the data from your lines, Odoo automatically proposes counterpart entries to you, based on the credit entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When an accounting entry is matched, Odoo moves it to the <code>Valid<\\/code> state automatically and prepares to enter the next data. Do not forget to definitely post the valid entries by clicking the Action button and selecting <code>Post Journal Entries<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you want to add some other balancing lines you can enter the number of the entry on the new line that you are entering. In such a case the whole line stays Draft until the whole set balances to zero.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"reconciliation\\\">Reconciliation Process<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>The reconciliation operation consists of matching entries in different accounts to indicate that they are related. Generally reconciliation is used for:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Matching invoice entries to payments, so that invoices are marked as paid and customers do not get payment reminder letters for those entries (reconciliation in a customer account).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Matching deposits and cheque withdrawals with their respective payments.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Matching invoices and credit notes to cancel them out.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>A reconciliation must be carried out on a list of accounting entries by an accountant, so that the sum of credits equals the sum of the debits for the matched entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reconciliation in Odoo can only be carried out in accounts that have been configured as reconcilable (the <code>Reconcile<\\/code> field).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Do not confuse account reconciliation and bank statement reconciliation<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is important not to confuse the reconciliation of accounting entries with bank statement reconciliation. Account reconciliation consists of linking account entries with each other, while statement reconciliation consists of verifying that your bank statement corresponds to the entries of that account in your accounting system.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>There are different methods of reconciling entries. You have already seen the reconciliation of entries while doing data entry in an account. Automatic and manual reconciliations are described here.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Automatic Reconciliation<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>For automatic reconciliation, you will be asking Odoo to search for entries to reconcile in a series of accounts. Odoo tries to find entries for each partner where the amounts correspond.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Depending on the level of complexity that you choose (= power) when you start running the tool, the software could reconcile from two to nine entries at the same time. For example, if you select level 5, Odoo will reconcile, for instance, three invoices and two payments if the total amounts correspond. Note that you can also choose a maximum write-off amount, if you allow payment differences to be posted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_reconcile_auto.png\\\" alt=\\\"account reconcile auto\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Form for Automatic Reconciliation<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To start the reconciliation tool, click <code>Accounting &gt; Periodical Processing &gt; Reconciliation &gt; Automatic Reconciliation<\\/code>. A form opens, asking you for the following information:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Add <code>Accounts to Reconcile<\\/code>: you can select one, several or all reconcilable accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The Reconciliation <code>Power<\\/code> (from 2 to 4).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Checkbox <code>Allow write<\\/code> off to determine whether you will allow for payment differences.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Information needed for the adjustment (details for the <code>Write-Off Move<\\/code>).<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can reconcile any account, but the most common accounts are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>All the Accounts Receivable \\u2013 your customer accounts of type Debtor.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>All the Accounts Payable \\u2013 your supplier accounts of type Creditor.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The write-off option enables you to reconcile entries even if their amounts are not exactly equivalent. For example, Odoo permits foreign customers whose accounts are in different currencies to have a difference of up to, say, 0.50 units of currency and put the difference in a write- off account.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You should not make the adjustment limits too large. Companies that introduced substantial automatic write-off adjustments have found that all employee expense reimbursements below the limit were written off automatically!<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Manual Reconciliation<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>For manual reconciliation, open the entries for reconciling an account through the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Periodical Processing &gt; Reconciliation &gt; Manual Reconciliation<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also call up manual reconciliation from any screen that shows accounting entries. Select entries that you want to reconcile. Odoo indicates the sum of debits and credits for the selected entries. When these are equal you can click the <code>Reconcile Entries<\\/code> button to reconcile the entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Suppose that you are entering customer order details. You wonder what is outstanding on the customer account (that is the list of unpaid invoices and unreconciled payments). To review it from the order form, navigate to the Partner record and select the view <code>Receivables<\\/code> and <code>Payables<\\/code>. Odoo opens a history of unreconciled accounting entries on screen.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>After running the <code>Reconcile Entries<\\/code> wizard, these lines can no longer be selected and will not appear when the entries are listed again. If there is a difference between the two entries, Odoo suggests you to make an adjustment. This write-off is a compensating entry that enables a complete reconciliation. You must therefore specify the journal and the account to be used for the <code>write-off<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For example, if you want to reconcile the following entries:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<table class=\\\"table\\\"><caption>Entries for reconciliation<\\/caption>\\r\\n<thead>\\r\\n<tr><th>Date<\\/th><th>Ref.<\\/th><th>Description<\\/th><th>Account<\\/th><th>Debit<\\/th><th>Credit<\\/th><\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/thead>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>12 May 11<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>INV23<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Car hire<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>4010<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>544.50<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>25 May 11<\\/td>\\r\\n<td><span style=\\\"font-size: 11px;\\\">INV44<\\/span><\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Car insurance<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>4010<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>100.00<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>31 May 11<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>PAY01<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Invoices n\\u00b0 23, 44<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>4010<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>644.00<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/tbody>\\r\\n<\\/table>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>On reconciliation, Odoo shows a difference of 0.50.

As soon as a statement is validated, the corresponding accounting entries are automatically generated by Odoo. So non-accounting people can enter financial transactions without having to worry about things such as credit, debit and counterparts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To enter a bank statement, go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Bank and Cash &gt; Bank Statements<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_statement.png\\\" alt=\\\"account statement\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Data Entry Form for a Bank Statement<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The statement reference <code>Name<\\/code> and the Date are automatically suggested by Odoo.

Ideally, when you are configuring your company, you would create at least one journal for each bank account and one journal for petty cash in your company. So select the journal corresponding to the bank account whose statement you are handling.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The currency that you are using for the statement line is that of the selected journal. If you are entering statement lines for an account in American Dollars (USD), the amounts must be entered in USD . The currency is automatically converted into the company\'s main currency when you confirm the entry, using the rates in effect at the date of entry. (This means that you would need valid currency conversion rates to be created first. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Currencies<\\/code> menu.)<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo automatically completes the initial balance based on the closing balance of the preceding statement. You can modify this value and force another value. This lets you enter statements in the order of your choice. Also if you have lost a page of your statement, you can enter the following ones immediately and you are not forced to wait for a duplicate from the bank.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So, complete the closing balance which corresponds to the new value in the account displayed on your bank statement.

Fill these fields manually in the following order:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Reference<\\/code>: reference from the invoice or entry.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Effective date<\\/code>: effective date of the entry, will be preset with today\'s date.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Period<\\/code>: financial period, will be preset with the current period.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Partner<\\/code>: partner concerned.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Account<\\/code>: general account (e.g. purchase account Products Purchase).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Name<\\/code>: description of the invoice line (e.g. PC2).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Debit<\\/code>: here you type the debit amount.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Journal<\\/code>: here you select the journal in which you want to post.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Credit<\\/code>: here you type the credit amount, e.g. 1196.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Press the <code>Enter<\\/code> key on your keyboard to validate the first line. The next draft move number is assigned to your accounting entry. Your line is then colored red and takes the <code>Unbalanced<\\/code> state. When a line is in the draft state, it is not yet reflected in the accounts. Odoo will not validate that line until the balancing entry is made (so the credit amounts must balance the debit amounts for that set of entries).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo now proposes the balancing accounting line to be filled in. If the account used (in this case account 600000) includes taxes by default Odoo automatically proposes taxes associated with the amount entered. At this stage you can modify and validate this second line of the account, or replace it with other information such as a second purchase line.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you have entered all of the data from your lines, Odoo automatically proposes counterpart entries to you, based on the credit entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When an accounting entry is matched, Odoo moves it to the <code>Valid<\\/code> state automatically and prepares to enter the next data. Do not forget to definitely post the valid entries by clicking the Action button and selecting <code>Post Journal Entries<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you want to add some other balancing lines you can enter the number of the entry on the new line that you are entering. In such a case the whole line stays Draft until the whole set balances to zero.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"reconciliation\\\">Reconciliation Process<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>The reconciliation operation consists of matching entries in different accounts to indicate that they are related. Generally reconciliation is used for:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Matching invoice entries to payments, so that invoices are marked as paid and customers do not get payment reminder letters for those entries (reconciliation in a customer account).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Matching deposits and cheque withdrawals with their respective payments.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Matching invoices and credit notes to cancel them out.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>A reconciliation must be carried out on a list of accounting entries by an accountant, so that the sum of credits equals the sum of the debits for the matched entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reconciliation in Odoo can only be carried out in accounts that have been configured as reconcilable (the <code>Reconcile<\\/code> field).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Do not confuse account reconciliation and bank statement reconciliation<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is important not to confuse the reconciliation of accounting entries with bank statement reconciliation. Account reconciliation consists of linking account entries with each other, while statement reconciliation consists of verifying that your bank statement corresponds to the entries of that account in your accounting system.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>There are different methods of reconciling entries. You have already seen the reconciliation of entries while doing data entry in an account. Automatic and manual reconciliations are described here.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Automatic Reconciliation<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>For automatic reconciliation, you will be asking Odoo to search for entries to reconcile in a series of accounts. Odoo tries to find entries for each partner where the amounts correspond.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Depending on the level of complexity that you choose (= power) when you start running the tool, the software could reconcile from two to nine entries at the same time. For example, if you select level 5, Odoo will reconcile, for instance, three invoices and two payments if the total amounts correspond. Note that you can also choose a maximum write-off amount, if you allow payment differences to be posted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_reconcile_auto.png\\\" alt=\\\"account reconcile auto\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Form for Automatic Reconciliation<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To start the reconciliation tool, click <code>Accounting &gt; Periodical Processing &gt; Reconciliation &gt; Automatic Reconciliation<\\/code>. A form opens, asking you for the following information:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Add <code>Accounts to Reconcile<\\/code>: you can select one, several or all reconcilable accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The Reconciliation <code>Power<\\/code> (from 2 to 4).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Checkbox <code>Allow write<\\/code> off to determine whether you will allow for payment differences.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Information needed for the adjustment (details for the <code>Write-Off Move<\\/code>).<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can reconcile any account, but the most common accounts are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>All the Accounts Receivable \\u2013 your customer accounts of type Debtor.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>All the Accounts Payable \\u2013 your supplier accounts of type Creditor.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The write-off option enables you to reconcile entries even if their amounts are not exactly equivalent. For example, Odoo permits foreign customers whose accounts are in different currencies to have a difference of up to, say, 0.50 units of currency and put the difference in a write- off account.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You should not make the adjustment limits too large. Companies that introduced substantial automatic write-off adjustments have found that all employee expense reimbursements below the limit were written off automatically!<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Manual Reconciliation<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>For manual reconciliation, open the entries for reconciling an account through the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Periodical Processing &gt; Reconciliation &gt; Manual Reconciliation<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also call up manual reconciliation from any screen that shows accounting entries. Select entries that you want to reconcile. Odoo indicates the sum of debits and credits for the selected entries. When these are equal you can click the <code>Reconcile Entries<\\/code> button to reconcile the entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Suppose that you are entering customer order details. You wonder what is outstanding on the customer account (that is the list of unpaid invoices and unreconciled payments). To review it from the order form, navigate to the Partner record and select the view <code>Receivables<\\/code> and <code>Payables<\\/code>. Odoo opens a history of unreconciled accounting entries on screen.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>After running the <code>Reconcile Entries<\\/code> wizard, these lines can no longer be selected and will not appear when the entries are listed again. If there is a difference between the two entries, Odoo suggests you to make an adjustment. This write-off is a compensating entry that enables a complete reconciliation. You must therefore specify the journal and the account to be used for the <code>write-off<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For example, if you want to reconcile the following entries:<\\/p>\\r\\n<table class=\\\"table\\\"><caption>Entries for reconciliation<\\/caption>\\r\\n<thead>\\r\\n<tr><th>Date<\\/th><th>Ref.<\\/th><th>Description<\\/th><th>Account<\\/th><th>Debit<\\/th><th>Credit<\\/th><\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/thead>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>12 May 11<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>INV23<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Car hire<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>4010<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>544.50<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>25 May 11<\\/td>\\r\\n<td><span style=\\\"font-size: 11px;\\\">INV44<\\/span><\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Car insurance<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>4010<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>100.00<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>31 May 11<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>PAY01<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Invoices n\\u00b0 23, 44<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>4010<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>644.00<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/tbody>\\r\\n<\\/table>\\r\\n<p>On reconciliation, Odoo shows a difference of 0.50. At this stage you have two possibilities:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Do not reconcile, and the customer receives a request for 0.50.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Reconcile and accept an adjustment of 0.50 that you will take from the P&amp;L account.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Odoo generates the following entry automatically:<\\/p>\\r\\n<table class=\\\"table\\\"><caption>Entries for reconciliation<\\/caption>\\r\\n<thead>\\r\\n<tr><th>Date<\\/th><th>Ref.<\\/th><th>Description<\\/th><th>Account<\\/th><th>Debit<\\/th><th>Credit<\\/th><\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/thead>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>03 Jun 11<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>AJ001<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Adjustment: profits and losses<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>4010<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;0.50<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>03 Jun 11<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>AJ001<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Adjustment: profits and losses<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>XXXX<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;0.50<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/tbody>\\r\\n<\\/table>\\r\\n<p>The two invoices and the payment will be reconciled in the first adjustment line. The two invoices will then be automatically marked as paid.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"payment\\\">Payment Management<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Odoo gives you forms to prepare, validate and execute payment orders. This enables you to manage issues such as:<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote><ol>\\r\\n<li>Payment provided on several due dates.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Automatic payment dates.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Separating payment preparation and payment approval in your company.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Preparing an order during the week containing several payments, then creating a payment file at the end of the week.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Creating a file for electronic payment which can be sent to a bank for execution.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Splitting payments depending on the balances available in your various bank accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<h3>How to Manage your Payment Orders?<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>To use the tool for managing payments you must first install the module <code>account_payment<\\/code>, or Go to menu <code>Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounting in eInvoicing &amp; Payments<\\/code> section tick <code>Manage payment orders<\\/code>. Supplier Payments are part of the core Odoo system.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The system lets you enter a series of payments to be carried out from your various bank accounts. Once the different payments have been registered, you can validate the payment orders. During validation you can modify and approve the payment orders, sending the order to the bank for electronic funds transfer.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For example, if you have to pay a supplier\'s invoice for a large amount you can split the payments amongst several bank accounts according to their available balance. To do this, you can prepare several draft orders and validate them once you are satisfied that the split is correct.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This process can also be regularly scheduled. In some companies, a payment order is kept in <code>Draft<\\/code> state and payments are added to the draft list each day. At the end of the week, the accountant reviews and confirms all the waiting payment orders.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Once the payment order is confirmed, there is still a validation step for an accountant to carry out. You could imagine that these orders would be prepared by an accounts clerk, and then approved by a manager to go ahead with payment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>An Odoo workflow is associated with each payment order. Select a payment order, and if you are in the developer mode Click on Debug View# and then select print workflow to print the payment order workflow.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can integrate more complex workflow rules to manage payment orders by adapting the workflow. For example, in some companies payments must be approved by a manager under certain cash flow or value limit conditions<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_payment_workflow.png\\\" alt=\\\"account payment workflow\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Payments Workflow<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In small businesses it is usually the same person who enters the payment orders and who validates them. In this case you should just click the two buttons, one after the other, to confirm the payment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"transfer\\\">Prepare and Transfer Orders<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>To enter a payment order, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Payment &gt; Payment Orders<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_payment_order.png\\\" alt=\\\"account payment order class=\\\" img-thumbnail=\\\"\\\" img-responsive=\\\"\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Entering a Payment Order<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo then proposes a reference number for your payment order.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You then have to choose a payment mode from the various methods available to your company. These have to be configured when you set up the accounting system using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Payment Mode<\\/code>. Some examples are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Cheques.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Bank transfer.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Visa card on a bank account.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Petty cash.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Then, you set the Preferred date for payment:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Due date<\\/code>: each operation will be effected at the invoice deadline date.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Directly<\\/code>: the operations will be effected when the orders are validated.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Fixed date<\\/code>: you must specify an effective payment date in the Scheduled date if fixed field that follows.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The date is particularly important for the preparation of electronic transfers, because banking interfaces enable you to select a future execution date for each operation. So to configure your Odoo, most simply you can choose to pay all invoices automatically by their deadline.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You must then select the invoices to pay. They can be entered manually in the field <code>Payment Line<\\/code>, but it is easier to add them automatically. For that, click <code>Select Invoices to Pay<\\/code> and Odoo will then propose lines with payment deadlines. For each deadline you can see:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The invoice <code>Payment Date<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The reference <code>Invoice Ref<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The deadline for the invoice.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The amount to be paid in the partner\'s default currency.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can then accept the payment proposed by Odoo, or select the entries that you will pay or not pay on that order. Odoo gives you all the necessary information to make a payment decision for each line item:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Account.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Supplier\'s bank account.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Amount that will be paid.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Amount to pay.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The supplier.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Total amount owed to the supplier.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Due date.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Date of creation.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can modify the first three fields on each line: the account, the supplier\'s bank account and the amount that will be paid. This arrangement is very practical because it gives you complete visibility of all the company\'s trade payables. You can pay only a part of an invoice, for example, and in preparing your next payment order Odoo automatically suggests payment of the remainder owed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When the payment has been prepared correctly, click <code>Confirm Payments<\\/code>. The payment then changes to the <code>Confirmed<\\/code> state and a new button appears that can be used to start the payment process.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can print the payment order to send it to the bank by clicking the <code>Print &gt; Payment Order<\\/code> at the top of the screen.<\\/p>\",\"state\":1,\"catid\":\"27\",\"created\":\"2015-08-13 12:10:23\",\"created_by\":\"836\",\"created_by_alias\":\"\",\"modified\":\"2015-08-15 01:28:06\",\"modified_by\":\"836\",\"checked_out\":\"836\",\"checked_out_time\":\"2015-08-15 00:38:36\",\"publish_up\":\"2015-08-13 12:10:23\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":14,\"ordering\":\"4\",\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"This section deals with: managing bank statements, managing cash, manual journal entries.\",\"access\":\"1\",\"hits\":\"8\",\"metadata\":\"{\\\"robots\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"rights\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"xreference\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"featured\":\"0\",\"language\":\"en-GB\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0'), ('888', '64', '8', '', '2015-08-15 01:31:44', '836', '596', '0dd4a62e806ba73867f5c63452f1d089d0dbcaa0', '{\"id\":64,\"parent_id\":\"1\",\"lft\":\"125\",\"rgt\":126,\"level\":1,\"path\":\"leaves-management\",\"title\":\"Leaves Management\",\"alias\":\"leaves-management\",\"note\":\"\",\"description\":null,\"published\":1,\"checked_out\":\"0\",\"checked_out_time\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"access\":1,\"params\":null,\"metadesc\":null,\"metakey\":null,\"metadata\":null,\"created_user_id\":\"836\",\"created_time\":\"2015-08-15 01:31:44\",\"created_by_alias\":\"\",\"modified_user_id\":\"0\",\"modified_time\":\"2015-08-15 01:31:44\",\"images\":null,\"urls\":null,\"hits\":\"0\",\"language\":\"*\",\"version\":\"1\",\"publish_up\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\"}', '0'), ('889', '102', '1', '', '2015-08-15 01:31:44', '836', '2295', '36587d903d7a71f973d79ca66f52340e090666a0', '{\"id\":102,\"asset_id\":284,\"title\":\"Holiday Management\",\"alias\":\"holiday-management\",\"introtext\":\"<p>You can manage leaves taken by employees using the <code>hr_holidays<\\/code> module.

It helps to revisit the list at the end of the day to verify that the number of hours of attendance in the company has been properly accounted for. The total entered is shown at the bottom right of the list of service hours.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>By default, Odoo is configured to show the amount of each service when an employee encodes the number of hours per project. You can modify this field by adding the attribute <code>invisible=True<\\/code> in the timesheet view.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>(And the way to do that is either to modify the view on the file system, or click on the logged in user at top-right and select <code>About Odoo<\\/code> and then select <code>Activate the developer mode<\\/code>.

The difference between product balances in the analytic account and in the general accounts, divided by the total number of hours worked, can then be applied to the cost of the product. Some companies adjust for that difference by carrying out another analytic operation at the end of the month in an account created for that purpose. This analytic account should have a balance that tends towards zero.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Because you have got a system with integrated timesheets, you can then:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>track the profitability of projects in the analytic accounts,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>look at the history of timesheet entries by project and by employee,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>regularly adjust hourly costs by comparing your rates with reality,<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h3>Project Cost Control<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Controlling the costs and the profitability of projects precisely is very important.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It enables you to make good estimates and to track budgets allocated to different services and their projects, such as sales and, R&amp;D costs. You can also refine your arguments on the basis of clear facts rather than guesses if you have to renegotiate a contract with a customer following a project slippage.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The analyses of profitability by project and by employee are available from the analytic accounts.

This gives you a simple way of managing forgotten sign-outs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Find employee attendance details from their forms in <code>Human Resources &gt; Employees &gt; Employees<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To get the detail of attendance from an employee\'s form in Odoo, you can use the available reports:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Attendances By Month<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Attendances By Week<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Attendance Error Report<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The last report highlights errors in attendance data entry.

All employees should complete their timesheets correctly because this forms the basis of planning control, and the financial management and invoicing of projects<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You will see in <code>Deliver Quality Services<\\/code> that you can automatically invoice services at the end of the month based on the timesheet. But at the same time, some contracts are limited to prepaid hours. These hours and their deduction from the original limit are also managed by these timesheets.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In such a situation, hours that are not coded into the timesheets represent lost money for the company. So it is important to establish effective follow-up of the services timesheets and their encoding. To set up a structure for control using timesheets you should install the module <code>hr_timesheet_sheet<\\/code> (Timesheets in the Reconfigure wizard).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/timesheet_flow.png\\\" alt=\\\"timesheet flow\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Process of approving a timesheet<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This module supplies a new screen enabling you to manage timesheets by period.

Some companies adjust for that difference by carrying out another analytic operation at the end of the month in an account created for that purpose. This analytic account should have a balance that tends towards zero.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Because you have got a system with integrated timesheets, you can then:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>track the profitability of projects in the analytic accounts,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>look at the history of timesheet entries by project and by employee,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>regularly adjust hourly costs by comparing your rates with reality,<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h3>Project Cost Control<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Controlling the costs and the profitability of projects precisely is very important.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It enables you to make good estimates and to track budgets allocated to different services and their projects, such as sales and, R&amp;D costs. You can also refine your arguments on the basis of clear facts rather than guesses if you have to renegotiate a contract with a customer following a project slippage.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The analyses of profitability by project and by employee are available from the analytic accounts. They take all of the invoices into account, and also take into account the cost of the time spent on each project.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"inout\\\">Manage attendance through Sign in \\/ Sign out<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>In some companies, staff have to sign in when they arrive at work and sign out again at the end of the day. If each employee has been linked to a system user, then they can sign in on Odoo by using the menu <code>Human Resources &gt; Attendances &gt; Sign in \\/ Sign out<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If an employee has forgotten to sign out on leaving, the system proposes that they sign out manually and type in the time that they left when they come in again the next day. This gives you a simple way of managing forgotten sign-outs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Find employee attendance details from their forms in <code>Human Resources &gt; Employees &gt; Employees<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To get the detail of attendance from an employee\'s form in Odoo, you can use the available reports:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Attendances By Month<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Attendances By Week<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Attendance Error Report<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The last report highlights errors in attendance data entry.

All employees should complete their timesheets correctly because this forms the basis of planning control, and the financial management and invoicing of projects<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You will see in <code>Deliver Quality Services<\\/code> that you can automatically invoice services at the end of the month based on the timesheet. But at the same time, some contracts are limited to prepaid hours. These hours and their deduction from the original limit are also managed by these timesheets.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In such a situation, hours that are not coded into the timesheets represent lost money for the company. So it is important to establish effective follow-up of the services timesheets and their encoding.
