This is useful when your accountants are not the people creating the initial invoice, but are still required to approve it before the invoice is entered into the accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>It enables you to create invoices in advance, without approving them at the same time. You are also able to list all of the invoices awaiting approval.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"proforma\\\">Open or Pro Forma Invoices<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>You can approve (or validate) an invoice in the <code>Open<\\/code> or <code>Pro-forma<\\/code> state. A pro forma invoice does not have an invoice number yet, nor accounting entries. It is commonly used as a preliminary invoice or for customs purposes. It is more formal than a draft invoice and a pro forma invoice can later be converted to an open invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Pro-forma in Invoice<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Go to menu <code>Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounting<\\/code> in eInvoicing &amp; Payments section tick <code>Allow pro-forma invoices<\\/code>. Then the Pro-forma will be shown in Invoice form.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>An open invoice has a unique invoice number. The invoice is sent to the customer and is marked on the system as awaiting payment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"reconciliation\\\">Reconciliation and Payments<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>In Odoo, an invoice is considered to be paid when its accounting entries have been reconciled with the payment entries. If there has not been a reconciliation, an invoice can remain in the <code>Open<\\/code> state until you have entered the payment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To avoid surprises, it is important to understand the idea of reconciliation and its link with invoice payment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You will find the <code>Paid\\/Reconciled<\\/code> checkbox on an invoice. It is checked if the Journal Entry of the invoice has been totally reconciled with one or several Journal Entries of payment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Reconciliation links entries in an account that cancel each other out \\u2013 they are reconciled to each other (sum of credits = sum of debits). This is generally applied to payments against corresponding invoices.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Without the reconciliation process, Odoo would be incapable of marking invoices that have been paid. Suppose that you have got the following situation for the <code>Smith and Offspring<\\/code> customer:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Invoice 145: 50.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Invoice 167: 120.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Invoice 184: 70.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>If you receive a payment of 120, Odoo will delay reconciliation because there is a choice of invoices to pay. It could either reconcile the payment against invoices 145 and 184 or against invoice 167.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>At regular intervals, and independent of the invoices, an automatic import procedure or a manual accounts procedure can be used to bring in bank statements. These comprise all of the payments of suppliers and customers and general transactions, such as between accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When an account is validated, the corresponding accounting entries are automatically generated by Odoo.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Invoices are marked as <code>Paid<\\/code> when accounting entries on the invoice have been reconciled with accounting entries about their payment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This reconciliation transaction can be carried out at various places in the process, depending on your preference:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>At data entry for the accounting statement.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Manually from the account records.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Automatically using Odoo\'s intelligent reconciliation.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can create the accounting records directly, without using the invoice and account statements. To do this, use the rapid data entry form in a journal. Some accountants prefer this approach because they are used to thinking in terms of accounting records rather than in terms of invoices and payments.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You should really use the forms designed for invoices and bank statements rather than manual data entry records, however. These are simpler and are managed within an error-controlling system.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"record\\\">Records-based Accounting System<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>All the accounting transactions in Odoo are based on records, whether they are created by an invoice or created directly.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So, customer reminders are generated quickly from the list of unreconciled entries in the trade receivables account for that partner. In a single reminder, you will find the whole set of unpaid invoices as well as unreconciled payments, such as advance payments.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Similarly, financial statements such as the general ledger, account balance, aged balance (or chronological balance) and the various journals are all based on accounting entries. It does not matter if you generated the entry from an invoice form or directly in the invoice journal. It is the same for the tax declaration and other statutory financial statements.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When using integrated accounting, you should still go through the standard billing process because some modules are directly dependent on invoice documents. For example, a sales order can be configured to wait for payment of the invoice before triggering a delivery. In such a case, Odoo automatically generates a draft invoice to send to the client.&nbsp;<\\/p>\",\"state\":\"1\",\"catid\":\"27\",\"created\":\"2015-08-09 00:46:16\",\"created_by\":\"836\",\"created_by_alias\":\"\",\"modified\":\"2015-08-09 01:25:22\",\"modified_by\":\"836\",\"checked_out\":\"0\",\"checked_out_time\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"publish_up\":\"2015-08-09 00:46:16\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":\"2\",\"ordering\":1,\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"In general, when you use all of Odoo\'s functionality, invoices do not need to be entered manually.

This means that your accounting information can be kept up-to-date all the time as orders are placed and received, and their taxes are calculated.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>At the same time, it allows people who have more accounting knowledge to keep full control over the accounting entries that are being generated. Each value proposed by Odoo can be modified later if needed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Start by manually entering a customer invoice. Use <code>Accounting &gt; Customers &gt; Customer Invoices<\\/code> and click on <code>Create<\\/code> button for this.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A new invoice form opens for entering information.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_customer_invoice.png\\\" alt=\\\"account customer invoice\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Entering a New Invoice<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The document is composed of three parts:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The top of the invoice, with customer information.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The main body of the invoice, with detailed invoice lines.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The bottom of the page, with some additional information, taxes, and the totals.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>To enter a document in Odoo ERPOnline, you should always fill in fields in the order they appear on screen. Doing it this way means that some of the later fields are filled in automatically from the selections made in earlier fields.

Payment conditions are generated by rules for the payment of the invoice.

Once the invoice heading is saved, you must enter the different invoice lines.

But they are all stored in the same object type in the system. You get the correct form for each of the four types of invoice from the menu you use to open it. The name of the tab enables you to tell the invoice types apart when you are working on them.<\\/p>\\r\\n\",\"fulltext\":\"\\r\\n<p>There are many advantages in deriving the different types of invoice from the same object. Two of the most important are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>In a multi-company environment with inter-company invoicing, a customer invoice in one company becomes a supplier invoice for the other.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>This enables you to work and search for all invoices from the same menu. If you are looking for an invoicing history, Odoo provides both supplier and customer invoices in the same list, as well as credit notes.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>A credit note is a document that enables you to cancel an invoice or part of an invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To access customer invoices in Odoo, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Customers &gt; Customer Invoices<\\/code>, and for supplier invoices, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Suppliers &gt; Supplier Invoices<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Most of the time, invoices are generated automatically by Odoo as they are generated from other processes in the system. So it is not usually necessary to create them manually, but simply approve or validate them. Odoo uses the following different ways of generating invoices:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>From Supplier or Customer Orders.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From receipt or dispatch of goods.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From work carried out (timesheets, see <a href=\\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=28&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;Itemid=213\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Key Features HR\\\">Key Features HR<\\/a>).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From closed tasks (see <a href=\\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:drive-your-projects&amp;catid=33:project-management&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;Itemid=213\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Drive your Projects\\\">Drive your Projects<\\/a>).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From fee charges or other rechargeable expenses.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The different processes generate <code>Draft<\\/code> invoices. These must then be approved by a suitable system user and sent to the customer. The different invoicing methods are detailed in the following sections and chapters.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is also possible to enter invoices manually. This is usually done for invoices that are not associated with an order (usually purchase orders) or <code>Credit Notes<\\/code>. Also, if the system has not been configured correctly you might need to edit the invoice before sending it to the customer.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For example, if you have not realized that the customer is tax-exempt, the invoice you generate from an order will contain tax at the normal rates. It is then possible to edit this out of the invoice before validating it.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"customerinvoice\\\">Entering a Customer Invoice<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>The principle of entering data for invoices in Odoo is very simple, as it enables non- accountant users to create their own invoices. This means that your accounting information can be kept up-to-date all the time as orders are placed and received, and their taxes are calculated.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>At the same time, it allows people who have more accounting knowledge to keep full control over the accounting entries that are being generated. Each value proposed by Odoo can be modified later if needed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Start by manually entering a customer invoice. Use <code>Accounting &gt; Customers &gt; Customer Invoices<\\/code> and click on <code>Create<\\/code> button for this.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A new invoice form opens for entering information.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_customer_invoice.png\\\" alt=\\\"account customer invoice\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Entering a New Invoice<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The document is composed of three parts:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The top of the invoice, with customer information.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The main body of the invoice, with detailed invoice lines.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The bottom of the page, with some additional information, taxes, and the totals.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>To enter a document in Odoo ERPOnline, you should always fill in fields in the order they appear on screen. Doing it this way means that some of the later fields are filled in automatically from the selections made in earlier fields. So select the Customer, and the following fields are completed automatically:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The invoice address corresponds to the customer contact that was given the address type of Invoice in the customer form (or otherwise the address type of Default).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The customer account corresponds to the account given in the Accounting which is found in a tab of the customer form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>A specific or a default payment condition can be defined for this customer in the <code>Accounting<\\/code> tab of the customer form. Payment conditions are generated by rules for the payment of the invoice. For example: 50% in 21 days and 50% in 60 days from the end of the month.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h3>Properties Fields<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The Properties fields on the Customer form or the Product form are multi-company fields. The value that the user sees in these fields depends on the company that the user works for.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you work in a multi-company environment that is using one database, you have several charts of accounts. Asset and liability accounts for a customer depend on the company that the user works for.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can reach more information from certain relation fields in Odoo.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In Odoo, a relation is commonly a hyperlink - it takes you to the main form for that entity, with all of the actions and links.<br \\/>So one way or another you can rapidly reach the customer\'s:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Current sales and purchases.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>CRM requests.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Open invoices.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Accounts records.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Payable and receivable accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can add more detailed additional information to the invoice and select the currency that you want to invoice in.

By default, Odoo takes account of all the taxes defined in the product form. Take the case of the following product:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Applicable taxes:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>TVA: 19.6% type TVA.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>DEEE: 5.5, type DEEE.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The DEEE tax (disposal of electronic and electrical equipment) is an ecological tax that was imposed in France from 2009. It is applied to batteries to finance their recycling and is a fixed sum that is applied to the before-tax amount on the invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you trade with a company in your own country, and your country has a DEEE-type tax, the applicable taxes for this invoice could be:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>DEEE: 5.5.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>TVA: 19.6%.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>If you sell to a customer in another company in the community (intracommunity), instead, then tax is not charged. In the partner form, in the tab <code>Accounting<\\/code>, the field <code>Fiscal Position<\\/code> maintains information whether the customer is within the region or not. When you create an invoice for this customer, Odoo will calculate the following taxes on the product:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>DEEE: 5.5.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>TVA intracommunity: 0%.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>If you have not entered the parameters in the customer form correctly, Odoo will suggest incorrect taxes in the invoice. That is not a real issue, because you can always modify the information directly in the invoice before approving it.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you create an invoice for a product that will only be bought or sold once, you do not have to encode a new product. Instead, you will have to provide quite a bit of information manually on the invoice line:<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Product Description.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Account.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Quantity.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Unit Price<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"cancelinvoice\\\">Cancelling an Invoice<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>By default, Odoo will not allow you to cancel an invoice once it has been approved. Since accounting entries have been created, you theoretically cannot go back and delete them. However, in some cases, it is more convenient to cancel an invoice when there is an error than to produce a credit note and reconcile the two entries. Your attitude to this will be influenced by current legislation in your accounting jurisdiction and your adherence to accounting purity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo accommodates either approach. Install the <code>account_cancel<\\/code> module. Then allow cancelling an invoice by checking the box <code>Allow Cancelling Entries<\\/code> in the Journal corresponding to this invoice. You will then be allowed to cancel the invoice if the following two conditions are met:<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote><ol>\\r\\n<li>The accounting entries have not been reconciled or paid: if they have, then you will have to cancel the reconciliation first.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The accounting period or the fiscal year has not already been closed: if it is closed then no modification is possible.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Cancelling an invoice has the effect of automatically modifying the corresponding accounting entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To be able to cancel invoices, you should install the module <code>account_cancel<\\/code>. You can cancel an invoice if the <code>Allow Cancelling Entries<\\/code> function has been activated in the journal and the entries have not yet been reconciled. You could then move it from <code>Cancelled<\\/code> to the <code>Draft<\\/code> state to modify it and regenerate it.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Some countries require you to have contiguously numbered invoices (that is, with no break in the sequence). If, after cancelling an invoice that you are not regenerating, you find yourself with a break in the numbering you would have to go and modify the sequence, redo the invoice and replace the sequence number with its original value.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can control the sequences using the menu <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Sequences &amp; Identifiers &gt; Sequences<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Cancelling an invoice will cause a break in the number sequence of your invoices. You are strongly advised to recreate this invoice and re-approve it to fill the hole in the numbering if you can.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The duplication function can be applied to all the system documents: you can duplicate anything \\u2013 a product, an order, or a delivery.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Instead of entering a new invoice each time, you can base an invoice on a similar preceding one and duplicate it. To do this, first search for a suitable existing invoice. In the web client, show the invoice in read-only (non-editable) form view, then click on <code>More<\\/code> and <code>Duplicate<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The duplication creates a new invoice in the <code>Draft<\\/code> state.

But they are all stored in the same object type in the system. You get the correct form for each of the four types of invoice from the menu you use to open it. The name of the tab enables you to tell the invoice types apart when you are working on them.<\\/p>\\r\\n\",\"fulltext\":\"\\r\\n<p>There are many advantages in deriving the different types of invoice from the same object. Two of the most important are:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>In a multi-company environment with inter-company invoicing, a customer invoice in one company becomes a supplier invoice for the other.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>This enables you to work and search for all invoices from the same menu. If you are looking for an invoicing history, Odoo provides both supplier and customer invoices in the same list, as well as credit notes.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>A credit note is a document that enables you to cancel an invoice or part of an invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To access customer invoices in Odoo, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Customers &gt; Customer Invoices<\\/code>, and for supplier invoices, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Suppliers &gt; Supplier Invoices<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Most of the time, invoices are generated automatically by Odoo as they are generated from other processes in the system. So it is not usually necessary to create them manually, but simply approve or validate them. Odoo uses the following different ways of generating invoices:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>From Supplier or Customer Orders.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From receipt or dispatch of goods.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From work carried out (timesheets, see <a href=\\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=28&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;Itemid=213\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Key Features HR\\\">Key Features HR<\\/a>).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From closed tasks (see <a href=\\\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:drive-your-projects&amp;catid=33:project-management&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;Itemid=213\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" title=\\\"Drive your Projects\\\">Drive your Projects<\\/a>).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>From fee charges or other rechargeable expenses.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The different processes generate <code>Draft<\\/code> invoices. These must then be approved by a suitable system user and sent to the customer. The different invoicing methods are detailed in the following sections and chapters.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is also possible to enter invoices manually. This is usually done for invoices that are not associated with an order (usually purchase orders) or <code>Credit Notes<\\/code>. Also, if the system has not been configured correctly you might need to edit the invoice before sending it to the customer.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For example, if you have not realized that the customer is tax-exempt, the invoice you generate from an order will contain tax at the normal rates. It is then possible to edit this out of the invoice before validating it.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"customerinvoice\\\">Entering a Customer Invoice<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>The principle of entering data for invoices in Odoo is very simple, as it enables non- accountant users to create their own invoices. This means that your accounting information can be kept up-to-date all the time as orders are placed and received, and their taxes are calculated.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>At the same time, it allows people who have more accounting knowledge to keep full control over the accounting entries that are being generated. Each value proposed by Odoo can be modified later if needed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Start by manually entering a customer invoice. Use <code>Accounting &gt; Customers &gt; Customer Invoices<\\/code> and click on <code>Create<\\/code> button for this.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>A new invoice form opens for entering information.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/account_customer_invoice.png\\\" alt=\\\"account customer invoice\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Entering a New Invoice<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The document is composed of three parts:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The top of the invoice, with customer information.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The main body of the invoice, with detailed invoice lines.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The bottom of the page, with some additional information, taxes, and the totals.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>To enter a document in Odoo ERPOnline, you should always fill in fields in the order they appear on screen. Doing it this way means that some of the later fields are filled in automatically from the selections made in earlier fields. So select the Customer, and the following fields are completed automatically:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The invoice address corresponds to the customer contact that was given the address type of Invoice in the customer form (or otherwise the address type of Default).<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The customer account corresponds to the account given in the Accounting which is found in a tab of the customer form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>A specific or a default payment condition can be defined for this customer in the <code>Accounting<\\/code> tab of the customer form. Payment conditions are generated by rules for the payment of the invoice. For example: 50% in 21 days and 50% in 60 days from the end of the month.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h3>Properties Fields<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The Properties fields on the Customer form or the Product form are multi-company fields. The value that the user sees in these fields depends on the company that the user works for.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you work in a multi-company environment that is using one database, you have several charts of accounts. Asset and liability accounts for a customer depend on the company that the user works for.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can reach more information from certain relation fields in Odoo.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In Odoo, a relation is commonly a hyperlink - it takes you to the main form for that entity, with all of the actions and links.<br \\/>So one way or another you can rapidly reach the customer\'s:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Current sales and purchases.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>CRM requests.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Open invoices.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Accounts records.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Payable and receivable accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can add more detailed additional information to the invoice and select the currency that you want to invoice in. Once the invoice heading is saved, you must enter the different invoice lines. You could use either of the two techniques:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Enter the whole field manually.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Use a product to complete the different fields automatically.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The invoice line description is more of a title than a comment. If you want to add more detailed comments you can use the field <code>Additional Information<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>So select the product <code>Laptop Customized<\\/code> in the product field in an invoice line. The following fields are then completed automatically:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Description<\\/code>: this comes from the product, in the language of the partner.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Account<\\/code>: determined by the purchase or sales account defined in the product properties. If no account is specified in the product form, Odoo uses the properties of the category that the product is associated with.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Unit of Measure<\\/code>: this is defined by default in the product form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Unit Price<\\/code>: this is given by the sales price in the product form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Taxes<\\/code>: provided by the product form and the partner form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>By default, Odoo invoices and processes the price without taxes \\u2013 they are managed as a separate amount. Odoo can manage tax inclusive prices when you check the Tax Included in Price field true when configuring the tax.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can enter several invoice lines and modify the values that are automatically completed by Odoo. Once the invoice lines have been entered, you can click (update) on the invoice to get the details of tax calculated such as:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Untaxed Amount.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Tax Amount.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Total Amount.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>In the <code>Other Info<\\/code> tab at the bottom you will find the details of the total calculated for different tax rates used in the invoice. Before approving the invoice you can modify the date and the accounting period, which are entered by default as today\'s date. A click on PRO-FORMA moves from the <code>Draft<\\/code> to <code>Pro-forma<\\/code> state. And click <code>Validate<\\/code> when you want to approve the invoice. It moves from the <code>Draft<\\/code> state to the <code>Open<\\/code> state.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In order to get the PRO-FORMA button on invoice, go to the menu <code>Settings &gt; Accounting, eInvoicing &amp; Payments<\\/code> section and click the boolean field <code>Allow pro-forma invoices<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you have validated an invoice, Odoo gives it a unique number from a defined sequence. By default it takes the form Journal Code\\/Year\\/Sequence Number for example, <code>SAJ\\/2010\\/005<\\/code>. You cannot modify an invoice number, but instead, you should modify the sequence numbers through the menu <code>Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounting, eInvoicing &amp; Payments<\\/code> section and provide <code>Next Invoice<\\/code> number<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Accounting entries corresponding to this invoice are automatically generated when you approve the invoice. You see the details by clicking the entry in the <code>Journal Entry<\\/code> field and searching there for the account moves generated by that invoice number.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Furthermore, you can also <code>Print<\\/code> or <code>Email<\\/code> your Invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"tax\\\">Tax Management<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Details on the product form determine the selection of applicable taxes for an invoice line. By default, Odoo takes account of all the taxes defined in the product form. Take the case of the following product:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Applicable taxes:\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>TVA: 19.6% type TVA.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>DEEE: 5.5, type DEEE.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The DEEE tax (disposal of electronic and electrical equipment) is an ecological tax that was imposed in France from 2009. It is applied to batteries to finance their recycling and is a fixed sum that is applied to the before-tax amount on the invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you trade with a company in your own country, and your country has a DEEE-type tax, the applicable taxes for this invoice could be:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>DEEE: 5.5.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>TVA: 19.6%.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>If you sell to a customer in another company in the community (intracommunity), instead, then tax is not charged. In the partner form, in the tab <code>Accounting<\\/code>, the field <code>Fiscal Position<\\/code> maintains information whether the customer is within the region or not. When you create an invoice for this customer, Odoo will calculate the following taxes on the product:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>DEEE: 5.5.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>TVA intracommunity: 0%.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>If you have not entered the parameters in the customer form correctly, Odoo will suggest incorrect taxes in the invoice. That is not a real issue, because you can always modify the information directly in the invoice before approving it.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you create an invoice for a product that will only be bought or sold once, you do not have to encode a new product. Instead, you will have to provide quite a bit of information manually on the invoice line:<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Product Description.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Account.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Quantity.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Unit Price<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"cancelinvoice\\\">Cancelling an Invoice<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>By default, Odoo will not allow you to cancel an invoice once it has been approved. Since accounting entries have been created, you theoretically cannot go back and delete them. However, in some cases, it is more convenient to cancel an invoice when there is an error than to produce a credit note and reconcile the two entries. Your attitude to this will be influenced by current legislation in your accounting jurisdiction and your adherence to accounting purity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo accommodates either approach. Install the <code>account_cancel<\\/code> module. Then allow cancelling an invoice by checking the box <code>Allow Cancelling Entries<\\/code> in the Journal corresponding to this invoice. You will then be allowed to cancel the invoice if the following two conditions are met:<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote><ol>\\r\\n<li>The accounting entries have not been reconciled or paid: if they have, then you will have to cancel the reconciliation first.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The accounting period or the fiscal year has not already been closed: if it is closed then no modification is possible.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Cancelling an invoice has the effect of automatically modifying the corresponding accounting entries.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To be able to cancel invoices, you should install the module <code>account_cancel<\\/code>. You can cancel an invoice if the <code>Allow Cancelling Entries<\\/code> function has been activated in the journal and the entries have not yet been reconciled. You could then move it from <code>Cancelled<\\/code> to the <code>Draft<\\/code> state to modify it and regenerate it.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Some countries require you to have contiguously numbered invoices (that is, with no break in the sequence). If, after cancelling an invoice that you are not regenerating, you find yourself with a break in the numbering you would have to go and modify the sequence, redo the invoice and replace the sequence number with its original value.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can control the sequences using the menu <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Sequences &amp; Identifiers &gt; Sequences<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Cancelling an invoice will cause a break in the number sequence of your invoices. You are strongly advised to recreate this invoice and re-approve it to fill the hole in the numbering if you can.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The duplication function can be applied to all the system documents: you can duplicate anything \\u2013 a product, an order, or a delivery.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Instead of entering a new invoice each time, you can base an invoice on a similar preceding one and duplicate it. To do this, first search for a suitable existing invoice. In the web client, show the invoice in read-only (non-editable) form view, then click on <code>More<\\/code> and <code>Duplicate<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The duplication creates a new invoice in the <code>Draft<\\/code> state. That enables you to modify it before approving it. Duplicating documents in Odoo is an intelligent function, which enables the duplicated invoice to be given its own sequence number, today\'s date, and the draft state, even if the preceding invoice has been paid.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"supplierinvoice\\\">Creating a Supplier Invoice<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>The form that manages supplier invoices is very similar to the one for customer invoices. However, it has been adapted to simplify rapid data entry and monitoring of the amounts recorded.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Many companies do not enter data on supplier invoices, but simply enter accounting data corresponding to the purchase journal.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This particularly applies to users that have focused on the accounting system rather than all the capabilities provided by an ERP system. The two approaches reach the same accounting result: some prefer one and others prefer the other depending on their skills.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>However, when you use the Purchase Management functions in Odoo you should work directly on invoices because they are provided from <code>Purchase Orders<\\/code> or <code>Goods Receipt<\\/code> documents.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To enter a new supplier invoice, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Suppliers &gt; Supplier Invoices<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Everything is similar to the customer invoice, starting with the Journal unless the default is acceptable, and then the Supplier, which will automatically complete the following fields<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Partner Account.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Unlike the customer invoice, you do not have to enter payment conditions \\u2013 simply a <code>Due Date<\\/code> if you want one. If you do not give a due date, Odoo assumes that this invoice will be paid in cash. If you want to enter more complete payment conditions than just the due date, you can use the <code>Payment Term<\\/code> field which you can find on the second tab <code>Other Info<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Indicate the <code>Currency<\\/code> if the invoice is not going to use the default currency, then you can enter the <code>Invoice Lines<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Just like the customer invoice, you have the choice of entering all the information manually or use a product to complete many of the fields automatically. When you enter a product, all of the following values are completed automatically:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The product <code>Account<\\/code> is completed from the properties of the product form or the Category of the product if nothing is defined on the product itself.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The <code>Taxes<\\/code> come from the product form and\\/or the partner form, based on the same principles as the customer invoice.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The <code>Quantity<\\/code> is set at 1 by default but can be changed manually.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Unit Price<\\/code>: this is given by the cost price in the product form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You can click (<code>update<\\/code>) on the invoice in the <code>Edit<\\/code> mode to get the details of tax calculated. Odoo automatically completes the <code>Invoice Date<\\/code> and the accounting period.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Accounting periods are treated as legal period declarations. For example, a tax declaration for an invoice depends on the accounting period and not on the date of invoicing.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Depending on whether your declarations are made monthly or quarterly, the fiscal year contains either twelve or four accounting periods.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The dates are shown in the document you created in the accounting system. They are used for calculating due dates.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The two pieces of information do not have to have the same date. If, for example, you receive an invoice dated <code>5th January<\\/code> which relates to goods or services supplied before <code>31st December<\\/code>, the invoice may be coded into the <code>December<\\/code> accounting period and thus be recognized in that period for the tax declaration, while the invoice can remain <code>5th January<\\/code> which remains the basis of the due date for payment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can find that the amounts do not correspond with what your supplier has given you on paper for reasons that can include:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>The supplier made a calculation error.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The amounts have been rounded differently.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h3>Rounding Tax<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>It often happens that a supplier adds 1 to the total because the tax calculation has been rounded upwards. Some tax amounts are not valid because of this rounding.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For example, it is impossible to arrive at the amount of 145.50 if you are working to a precision of 2 decimal places and a rate of 19.6%:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>121.65 x 1.196 = 145.49<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>121.66 x 1.196 = 145.51<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>In this case you can add a row in the Taxes so that you can adjust a total.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When the totals tally, you can validate the invoice. Odoo then generates the corresponding accounting entries. You can manage those entries using the <code>Account<\\/code> fields on the invoice and on each of the invoice lines.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"refund\\\">Credit Notes \\/ Refunds<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Entering a customer credit note is almost identical to entering a customer invoice. You just start from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Customers &gt; Customer Refunds<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Similarly, entering a supplier credit note is the same as that of the supplier invoice, and so you use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Suppliers &gt; Supplier Refunds<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is easy to generate a credit note quickly from an existing invoice. To do this, select a customer or supplier invoice which is in <code>Paid<\\/code> state and click the <code>Refund<\\/code> button. Odoo opens a new payment invoice form for you in the <code>Draft<\\/code> state so that you can modify it before approval.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Below you find the different options displayed when you click the <code>Refund<\\/code> button on an invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Create a Draft Refund<\\/code>: Creates a draft credit note of the complete invoice. You can change this credit note, i.e. to make a partial credit note.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Modify<\\/code>: Creates a credit note for the existing invoice, validates the credit note and reconciles it with the invoice. The existing invoice is duplicated so that you can modify it.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Cancel<\\/code>: Creates a credit note for the complete invoice, validates the credit note and reconciles it with the invoice concerned.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"payment\\\">Payments<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>An invoice is automatically marked as <code>Paid<\\/code> by Odoo once invoice entries have been reconciled with payment entries. You yourself do not have to mark the invoices as paid: Odoo manages that when you reconcile your payments.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Generally, you reconcile the invoice\'s accounting entries with their payment(s). But you can also reconcile an invoice with the entries from the corresponding credit note instead, to mutually cancel them.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You have seen the <code>Register Payment<\\/code> button in the invoice form which is in <code>Open<\\/code> state. This lets you enter payments and get entries reconciled very quickly.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also manage the payment of invoices when you are entering bank statements and cash transactions. These allow better control of financial transactions and permit greater flexibility in areas such as:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Advance and partial payments of invoices.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Payment of several invoices by several payments.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Fine-grained management of different due dates on the same invoices.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Management of adjustments if there are different amounts to those on the invoice.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\",\"state\":1,\"catid\":\"27\",\"created\":\"2015-08-09 01:24:48\",\"created_by\":\"836\",\"created_by_alias\":\"\",\"modified\":\"2015-08-09

And the company that this employee works for in <code>Company<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Even if the employee is not a user, it is best if you create a system access for most of your staff just so that you can control their access rights from the outset (and you can do that through this field if you need to).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If the employee has a user account on the system, you always link his or her user account to the employee form.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Creating this link enables automatic completion to be done on the <code>Employee<\\/code> field in the relevant forms, such as services and expense records.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Then enter the employee\'s address.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This appears in the partner contact form in Odoo. Since employees are people that have contracts with your company, it is logical that they have entries like any other partner in your database. So enter the name of the employee as a new partner <code>Name<\\/code> and the address. Then all of the functions that apply to a partner can also be applied to an employee. This is particularly useful for tracking debits and credits in the accounts \\u2013 so you can track salary payments, for example.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To help employees encode and validate timesheets and attendances, you can install <code>hr_timesheet_sheet<\\/code> by going to the menu <code>Settings &gt; Modules &gt; Local Modules<\\/code>. You can then set both an analytic journal and linked a product to an employee in the <code>HR Settings<\\/code> tab of employee form. If you do it that way, then this information can be used to track services. For now, just complete the form with the following information:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Analytic Journal<\\/code>: usually a Timesheet Journal.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Product<\\/code>: a service product that describes how this employee would be charged out, for example as Service on Timesheet.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>At the top right of the form you can find button which will lead you to the <code>Timesheets<\\/code> associated with that employee.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"billing\\\">Define employees\' billing prices and costs<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>To be able to use the timesheets at all, you must first define those employees who are system users. The employee definition forms contain the information necessary to use that sheet, such as the job title, and hourly costs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Two fields will be of particular interest to you for managing timesheets: the <code>Analytic Journal<\\/code> and the <code>Product<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>All the analytic entries about the costs of service times will be stored in the analytic journal. These enable you to isolate the cost of service from other company costs, such as the purchase of raw materials, expenses receipts and subcontracting. You can use different journals for each employee to separate costs by department or by function.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The employee is also associated with a product in your database in Odoo. An employee is linked with a product, so they can be \'bought\' (subcontracting) or \'invoiced\' (project management). You have to create a product for each job type in your company.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The following information is important in the product form:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Name<\\/code>: Secretary , Salesperson or Project Manager.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Product Type<\\/code>: Service.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Unit of Measure<\\/code>: Hour or Day.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Cost Price<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Sale Price<\\/code>.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Costing Method<\\/code>: either Standard Price or Average Price.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>When the Costing Method is <code>Average Price<\\/code> in the Product form, you can have a button <code>Update<\\/code>, beside the <code>Cost Price<\\/code> field, that opens up a wizard for changing the cost price.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In summary, each company employee corresponds, in most cases, to:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>A Partner.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>A Employee form.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>A System User.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>And each company job position corresponds to a Product.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>By default, the hourly cost of an employee is given by the standard cost of the product linked to that employee. But if you install the <code>hr_contract<\\/code> module, it is possible to manage contracts differently. The hourly cost of the employee is then automatically calculated from their employment contract when they enter their timesheet data.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To do this, the software uses a factor defined in the contract (for example, contract type, wages, working schedule, etc). Ideally, this factor should take into account the salary costs, taxes, insurances and other overheads associated with pay.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"category\\\">Define employee categories<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>You must create and assign employee categories for employees in order to be able to assign and manage leave and allocation requests by category.

The first item on the list is the one that will be used by default.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Once a package has been defined on the order, Odoo will throw up an alert if the ordered quantities do not correspond to the proposed packages. The quantity must be a multiple of the field <code>Quantity by Package<\\/code> defined on the packaging form.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/sale_warning_packaging.png\\\" alt=\\\"sale warning packaging\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Alert on the Quantities sold compared to the Packaging<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Do not confuse the management of packaging with the management of multiple units of measure. The Unit of Measure is used to manage the stock differently according to the various units. With packages, the stock is always managed by individual items, but information about the package to use is supplied to the storesperson along with that item.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Even if the effects are the same, the printed documents will be different. The two following operations have the same effect on stock movement levels, but will be printed differently on the sales order and the packing order as where quantities are concerned:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>32,000 batteries, delivered on two palettes,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>2 palettes of batteries, with no information about packaging.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>If the customer wants to order a palette and 10 packs, the salesperson can put two order lines on the sales order using the same product with different units of measure.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>It is sometimes more useful to define different products than to define several possible packages for the same product. A case of beer in a supermarket is a good example. A case holds 24 bottles, plus the empty case itself. The customer can buy bottles by the piece or a case of 24 bottles at one go.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You could define two packages for the Bottle of beer : PCE and case . But this representation does not let you manage the stock and price of empty cases. So you might instead prefer a Bill of Materials, defining and using three different products:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>the empty case for the beer,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>the bottle of beer,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>the case of 24 bottles of beer.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>You also define the bill of materials below which determines the make-up of the case of 24 beers:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Case of 24 bottles of beer: 1 unit,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Bottle of beer: 24 units,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Empty case of beer: 1 unit.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Each of these three products has a different price. The products Bottle of beer and Empty case of beer have a stock level that needs to be managed. The Case of 24 bottles of beer has no stock because, if you sell the product, Odoo automatically moves the stock in two lines, one for the empty case and the other for the 24 individual bottles of beer.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;<\\/p>\",\"state\":\"1\",\"catid\":\"29\",\"created\":\"2015-08-10 01:04:40\",\"created_by\":\"836\",\"created_by_alias\":\"\",\"modified\":\"2015-08-10 01:09:38\",\"modified_by\":\"836\",\"checked_out\":\"0\",\"checked_out_time\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"publish_up\":\"2015-08-10 01:04:40\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":\"2\",\"ordering\":1,\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"Odoo\'s package management enables you to sell the same product in several different forms.

To do this, you could create a Warning on the Picking in the Customer form of the partner concerned, saying that no deliveries are allowed on Tuesday morning.&nbsp;<\\/p>\",\"state\":\"1\",\"catid\":\"29\",\"created\":\"2015-08-10 01:09:34\",\"created_by\":\"836\",\"created_by_alias\":\"\",\"modified\":\"2015-08-10 01:18:19\",\"modified_by\":\"836\",\"checked_out\":\"0\",\"checked_out_time\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"publish_up\":\"2015-08-10 01:09:34\",\"publish_down\":\"0000-00-00 00:00:00\",\"images\":\"{\\\"image_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_intro_caption\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"float_fulltext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_alt\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"image_fulltext_caption\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"urls\":\"{\\\"urla\\\":false,\\\"urlatext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targeta\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlb\\\":false,\\\"urlbtext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetb\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urlc\\\":false,\\\"urlctext\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"targetc\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"attribs\":\"{\\\"show_title\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_titles\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_tags\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_intro\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"info_block_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_parent_category\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"link_author\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_create_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_modify_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publish_date\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_item_navigation\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_icons\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_print_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_email_icon\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_vote\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_hits\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_noauth\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"urls_position\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"alternative_readmore\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"article_layout\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_publishing_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_article_options\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_backend\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"show_urls_images_frontend\\\":\\\"\\\"}\",\"version\":\"2\",\"ordering\":2,\"metakey\":\"\",\"metadesc\":\"You can activate alerts for a series of events.

First of all, give the rule a name. Then set the condition for which this rule is applicable, for example Weight &lt; 0.5kg.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Weights are always expressed in kilograms. You can define a number with a decimal point or comma, so to set 500g you would put 0.5 in the weight rule.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Next you can set the sales price and the cost price. Prices can be expressed in various ways:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>a fixed price,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>a variable price, as a function of weight, volume, weight x volume or price.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>For example, mailing within France using current tariffs would be defined as shown in the table below:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<table class=\\\"table\\\"><caption>Example Tariff Rules<\\/caption>\\r\\n<thead>\\r\\n<tr><th>Name<\\/th><th>Condition<\\/th><th>Price<\\/th><th>Price Type<\\/th><\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/thead>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>S<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Weight &lt; 3 kg<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>6.90<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Fixed<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>M<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Weight &lt; 5 kg<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>7.82<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Fixed<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>L<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Weight &lt; 6 kg<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>8.53<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Fixed<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr>\\r\\n<td>XL<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Weight &lt; 7 kg<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>9.87<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>Fixed<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/tbody>\\r\\n<\\/table>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You can also define rules that depend on the total amount on the order.

By default, products are managed using standard price in Odoo (cost price fixed manually and reviewed once per year). You can change that to <code>Average Price<\\/code>, meaning that the product cost fluctuates with purchases from suppliers. After product receipt you can include fixed costs, such as delivery costs, in the cost of each product.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Odoo supports a third method of updating the cost price of products. This is through the button Update on the product form which lets you automatically recalculate the cost price for the selected product. The cost price is calculated from the raw materials and the operations carried out (if the products have been manufactured internally, so that you have set their costs).<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"product\\\">Margins by Product<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>To track margins by product, install the module <code>product_margin<\\/code>.

If no period is given, Odoo will calculate margins on all of the operations without restriction.

So the pricelist for walk-in customers could have five different versions, for example: <code>Autumn<\\/code>, <code>Summer<\\/code>, <code>Summer Sales<\\/code>, <code>Winter<\\/code>, <code>Spring<\\/code>. Direct customers will see prices that change with the seasons.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Each pricelist is expressed in a single currency. If your company sells products in several currencies, you will have to create as many pricelists as you have currencies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The prices on a pricelist can depend on another list, which means that you do not have to repeat the definition of all conditions for each product. So a pricelist in USD can be based on a pricelist in EUR. If the currency conversion rates between EUR and USD change, or the EUR prices change, the USD rates can be automatically adjusted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"create\\\">Creating Price Lists<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>You can define a pricelist from the menu <code>Sales &gt; Configuration &gt; Pricelists &gt; Pricelists<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For each list you should define:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>a <code>Name<\\/code> for the list,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>a <code>Type<\\/code> of list: Sale for customers or Purchase for suppliers,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>the <code>Currency<\\/code> in which the prices are expressed.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h3>Price List Versions<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Once the pricelist is defined you have to link at least one version. You can create a new version directly from the pricelist or from the <code>Sales &gt; Configuration &gt; Pricelists &gt; Pricelist Versions<\\/code> menu. The version contains all of the rules that enable you to calculate a price for a product and a given quantity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Start by setting the Name of this associated version. If the list only has a single version, you can use the same name for the pricelist and the version. In the <code>Price List<\\/code> field, select the pricelist you created (this is not necessary if you create the version directly from the pricelist).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Then set the <code>Start Date<\\/code> and <code>End Date<\\/code> of this version. The fields are both optional: if you do not set any dates the version will be permanently active. Only one version may be active at any one point, so bear this in mind when creating them. Use the Active field in the versions to activate or disable a pricelist version.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Any sales pricelist can be set to depend on one of the other pricelists. So you could create your sales pricelist based on the supplier\'s purchase pricelist, to which you add a margin. The prices are automatically calculated as a function of the purchase price and need no further manual adjustment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Calculation Rules<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>A pricelist version is made up of a set of rules that apply to the basic product prices.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/service_pricelist_line.png\\\" alt=\\\"service pricelist line\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Rule in a Pricelist Version<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You define the conditions for a rule . The rule applies to the <code>Product<\\/code> or <code>Product Template<\\/code> and\\/or the named <code>Product Category<\\/code>. If a rule is applied to a category, then it is automatically applied to all of its subcategories too (using the tree structure for product categories).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you set a minimum quantity in <code>Min. Quantity<\\/code>, the rule will only apply to a quantity equal to or larger than the quantity set. This way, you can define reduced rates in steps according to the quantities ordered.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Several rules can be applied to an order. Odoo evaluates these rules by sequence number, to determine which rule(s) to apply to the specified price calculation. If several rules are valid, only the first in sequence is used for the calculation. The <code>Sequence<\\/code> field determines the order, starting with the lowest number and working up.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Once a rule has been selected, the system has to determine how to calculate the price from the rule. This operation is based on the criteria set out in the lower part of the form, labelled Price Computation.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The first field to complete is <code>Based on<\\/code>. Set the way in which the partner price will be calculated, choosing between:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>the <code>Public Price<\\/code> set in the product file,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>the <code>Cost Price<\\/code> set in the product file,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>an <code>Other Pricelist<\\/code> given in the field If Other Pricelist<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>the price that varies as a function of a supplier defined in the Supplier Prices on the product form<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Several other criteria can be considered and added to the list, as you will see in the following section.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Next, various operations can be applied to the basic price to calculate the sales or purchase price for the partner, according to the specified quantities. To calculate it, you apply the formula shown on the form: <code>Price = Base Price x (1 + Field1) + Field2<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The first field, <code>Field1<\\/code>, defines a discount or a supplement. Set it to -0.20 for a discount of 20% from the basic price. If your price is based on standard cost, you can set 0.15 to get a 15% price uplift compared to the standard costs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><code>Field2<\\/code> sets a fixed supplement to the price, expressed in the currency of the pricelist. This amount is just added (or subtracted, if negative) to the amount calculated with the <code>Field1<\\/code> discount.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Then you can specify a rounding method. The rounding calculation is carried out to the nearest number. For example if you set 0.05 in this example, a price of 45.66 will be rounded to 45.65, and 14,567 rounded to 100 will give a price of 14,600.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In Switzerland, the smallest monetary unit is 5 cents. There are not any 1 or 2 cent coins. So you set Odoo\'s rounding to 0.05 to round everything in a Swiss franc pricelist.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The supplement from <code>Field2<\\/code> is applied before the rounding calculation, which enables some interesting effects. For example, if you want all your prices to end in 9.99, set your rounding to 10 and your supplement to -0.01 in <code>Field2<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Minimum and Maximum margins enable you to guarantee a given margin over the base price. A margin of 10 USD enables you to stop the discount from returning less than that margin. If you put 0 into this field, no effect is taken into account.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Once the pricelist is defined, you can assign it to a customer. Go to the Customer form and select its <code>Sales &amp; Purchases<\\/code> tab. You can then change the <code>Purchase Pricelist<\\/code> and the <code>Sale Pricelist<\\/code> that is loaded by default for the customer.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Decimal Accuracy<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>There are several configuration settings related to the decimal accuracy of prices, or the number of decimal places to hold with each price field. To change the accuracy of a field, follow these steps:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>First make sure that you have give the access rights to user.<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Go to <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Database Structure &gt; Decimal Accuracy<\\/code>. This list contains a number of predefined elements.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Open the entry you want to change. <code>Purchase Price<\\/code> and <code>Sale Price<\\/code> are the most common ones related to prices, but some fields are controlled by the Account entry.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Type a new value in the digits field, and save the entry. Do not change the description in the <code>Usage<\\/code> field, or it will stop working.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Close the screen where you were editing prices and reopen it. The price field should now have the number of digits you asked for.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"example\\\">Example of a Pricelist<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Take the case of an IT systems trading company, for which the following product categories have been configured:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>All products<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote><ol>\\r\\n<li>Accessories\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Printers<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Scanners<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Keyboards and Mice<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Computers\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Portables<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type: none;\\\">\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Large-screen portables<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Computers<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type: none;\\\">\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Office Computers<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Professional Computers<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<p>In addition, the products presented in the table below are defined in the currency of the installed chart of accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<table class=\\\"table\\\"><caption>Examples of products with their different prices<\\/caption>\\r\\n<thead>\\r\\n<tr class=\\\"row-odd\\\"><th>Product<\\/th><th>Sale Price<\\/th><th>Cost Price<\\/th><th>Default supplier price<\\/th><\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/thead>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr class=\\\"row-even\\\">\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s9925ccaaceea4b80826821aeb12e392b\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">Acclo Portable<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"see92c703bdf84203a2f9e787c8e011d6\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">1,200<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s8a526c19d94a42a993bd595a6d56a1b2\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">887<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"sa5e96ac7da734449adde6914f782ae84\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">893<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr class=\\\"row-odd\\\">\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"sca0d03d95e9a4f4b93f0deb096835d81\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">Toshibishi Portable<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s79fefc16709f4a519a22d649280927ae\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">1,340<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"sc3e6a2b0344745d6a140e5101533e8a9\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">920<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s15ec6782992c4f7193e505c075761fd0\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">920<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr class=\\\"row-even\\\">\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s0584dc0af9d84ebaa5f3e78580d48789\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">Berrel Keyboard<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s01fc1a43dde045bbaae72725d36406fe\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">100<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s871f9a7a4b554aa18234f9173d5d1277\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">50<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s2e75d6e02b9c433385ed702995d682aa\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">50<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr class=\\\"row-odd\\\">\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"sc458ad40379f45fdbfb6bd3e62ca2600\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">Office Computer<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s4373fecf8af2485f9eb1e5da4ee3ab62\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">1,400<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"sf03e70970abd4d88af8e5b33f3188872\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">1,000<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s9104a0465538450682f0cbcb3e6b3023\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">1,000<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/tbody>\\r\\n<\\/table>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Default Price Lists<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/product_pricelist_default.png\\\" alt=\\\"product pricelist default\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Default pricelist after installing Odoo<code><\\/code><\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you install the software, two pricelists are created by default: one for sales and one for purchases.

Many forms of price variation are used, such as end-of-year refunds, discounts, change of terms and conditions with time, various prepayments, cascaded rebates, seasonal promotions, and progressive price reductions.<\\/p>\\r\\n\",\"fulltext\":\"\\r\\n<p>In some accounting jurisdictions you have to differentiate between the three following terms:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Rebate: reimbursement to the client, usually at the end of the year, that depends on the quantity of goods purchased over a period.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Refund: reduction on the order line or invoice line if a certain quantity of goods is purchased at one time or is sold in a framework of a promotional activity.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Reduction: a one-off reduction resulting from a quality defect or a variation in a product\'s conformance to a specification.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Intelligent price management is difficult, because it requires you to integrate several conditions from clients and suppliers to create estimates quickly or to invoice automatically. But if you have an efficient price management mechanism you can often keep margins raised and respond quickly to changes in market conditions. A good price management system gives you scope for varying any and all of the relevant factors when you are negotiating a contract.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To help you work most effectively, Odoo\'s pricelist principles are extremely powerful yet are based on simple and generic rules. You can develop both sales pricelists and purchase pricelists for products capable of accommodating conditions such as the date period, the quantity requested and the type of product.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Do not confuse the sales price with the basic price of the product. In Odoo\'s basic configuration, the sales price is the list price specified in the product form, but a customer can have a different sales price depending on the conditions.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The same applies to the purchase price and standard cost. Purchase price is your suppliers\' selling price, which changes in response to different criteria such as quantities, dates, and supplier. This is automatically set by the accounting system. You will find that the two prices have been set by default to the same for all products with the demonstration data, which can be a source of confusion. You are free to set the standard cost to something different.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Each pricelist is calculated from defined policies, so you will have as many sales pricelists as active sales policies in the company. For example, a company that sells products through three sales channels could create the following price lists:<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote><ol>\\r\\n<li>Main distribution:\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Pricelist for Walbury<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Pricelist for TesMart<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Postal Sales.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Walk-in customers.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<p>A single pricelist can exist in several versions, only one of which is permitted to be active at a given time. These versions let you set different prices at different points in time. So the pricelist for walk-in customers could have five different versions, for example: <code>Autumn<\\/code>, <code>Summer<\\/code>, <code>Summer Sales<\\/code>, <code>Winter<\\/code>, <code>Spring<\\/code>. Direct customers will see prices that change with the seasons.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Each pricelist is expressed in a single currency. If your company sells products in several currencies, you will have to create as many pricelists as you have currencies.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The prices on a pricelist can depend on another list, which means that you do not have to repeat the definition of all conditions for each product. So a pricelist in USD can be based on a pricelist in EUR. If the currency conversion rates between EUR and USD change, or the EUR prices change, the USD rates can be automatically adjusted.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"create\\\">Creating Price Lists<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>You can define a pricelist from the menu <code>Sales &gt; Configuration &gt; Pricelists &gt; Pricelists<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>For each list you should define:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>a <code>Name<\\/code> for the list,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>a <code>Type<\\/code> of list: Sale for customers or Purchase for suppliers,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>the <code>Currency<\\/code> in which the prices are expressed.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h3>Price List Versions<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Once the pricelist is defined you have to link at least one version. You can create a new version directly from the pricelist or from the <code>Sales &gt; Configuration &gt; Pricelists &gt; Pricelist Versions<\\/code> menu. The version contains all of the rules that enable you to calculate a price for a product and a given quantity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Start by setting the Name of this associated version. If the list only has a single version, you can use the same name for the pricelist and the version. In the <code>Price List<\\/code> field, select the pricelist you created (this is not necessary if you create the version directly from the pricelist).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Then set the <code>Start Date<\\/code> and <code>End Date<\\/code> of this version. The fields are both optional: if you do not set any dates the version will be permanently active. Only one version may be active at any one point, so bear this in mind when creating them. Use the Active field in the versions to activate or disable a pricelist version.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Any sales pricelist can be set to depend on one of the other pricelists. So you could create your sales pricelist based on the supplier\'s purchase pricelist, to which you add a margin. The prices are automatically calculated as a function of the purchase price and need no further manual adjustment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Calculation Rules<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>A pricelist version is made up of a set of rules that apply to the basic product prices.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/service_pricelist_line.png\\\" alt=\\\"service pricelist line\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Rule in a Pricelist Version<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You define the conditions for a rule . The rule applies to the <code>Product<\\/code> or <code>Product Template<\\/code> and\\/or the named <code>Product Category<\\/code>. If a rule is applied to a category, then it is automatically applied to all of its subcategories too (using the tree structure for product categories).<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you set a minimum quantity in <code>Min. Quantity<\\/code>, the rule will only apply to a quantity equal to or larger than the quantity set. This way, you can define reduced rates in steps according to the quantities ordered.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Several rules can be applied to an order. Odoo evaluates these rules by sequence number, to determine which rule(s) to apply to the specified price calculation. If several rules are valid, only the first in sequence is used for the calculation. The <code>Sequence<\\/code> field determines the order, starting with the lowest number and working up.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Once a rule has been selected, the system has to determine how to calculate the price from the rule. This operation is based on the criteria set out in the lower part of the form, labelled Price Computation.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The first field to complete is <code>Based on<\\/code>. Set the way in which the partner price will be calculated, choosing between:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>the <code>Public Price<\\/code> set in the product file,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>the <code>Cost Price<\\/code> set in the product file,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>an <code>Other Pricelist<\\/code> given in the field If Other Pricelist<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>the price that varies as a function of a supplier defined in the Supplier Prices on the product form<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Several other criteria can be considered and added to the list, as you will see in the following section.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Next, various operations can be applied to the basic price to calculate the sales or purchase price for the partner, according to the specified quantities. To calculate it, you apply the formula shown on the form: <code>Price = Base Price x (1 + Field1) + Field2<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The first field, <code>Field1<\\/code>, defines a discount or a supplement. Set it to -0.20 for a discount of 20% from the basic price. If your price is based on standard cost, you can set 0.15 to get a 15% price uplift compared to the standard costs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><code>Field2<\\/code> sets a fixed supplement to the price, expressed in the currency of the pricelist. This amount is just added (or subtracted, if negative) to the amount calculated with the <code>Field1<\\/code> discount.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Then you can specify a rounding method. The rounding calculation is carried out to the nearest number. For example if you set 0.05 in this example, a price of 45.66 will be rounded to 45.65, and 14,567 rounded to 100 will give a price of 14,600.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In Switzerland, the smallest monetary unit is 5 cents. There are not any 1 or 2 cent coins. So you set Odoo\'s rounding to 0.05 to round everything in a Swiss franc pricelist.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The supplement from <code>Field2<\\/code> is applied before the rounding calculation, which enables some interesting effects. For example, if you want all your prices to end in 9.99, set your rounding to 10 and your supplement to -0.01 in <code>Field2<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Minimum and Maximum margins enable you to guarantee a given margin over the base price. A margin of 10 USD enables you to stop the discount from returning less than that margin. If you put 0 into this field, no effect is taken into account.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Once the pricelist is defined, you can assign it to a customer. Go to the Customer form and select its <code>Sales &amp; Purchases<\\/code> tab. You can then change the <code>Purchase Pricelist<\\/code> and the <code>Sale Pricelist<\\/code> that is loaded by default for the customer.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Decimal Accuracy<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>There are several configuration settings related to the decimal accuracy of prices, or the number of decimal places to hold with each price field. To change the accuracy of a field, follow these steps:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>First make sure that you have give the access rights to user.<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>Go to <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Database Structure &gt; Decimal Accuracy<\\/code>. This list contains a number of predefined elements.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Open the entry you want to change. <code>Purchase Price<\\/code> and <code>Sale Price<\\/code> are the most common ones related to prices, but some fields are controlled by the Account entry.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Type a new value in the digits field, and save the entry. Do not change the description in the <code>Usage<\\/code> field, or it will stop working.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Close the screen where you were editing prices and reopen it. The price field should now have the number of digits you asked for.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"example\\\">Example of a Pricelist<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Take the case of an IT systems trading company, for which the following product categories have been configured:<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>All products<\\/p>\\r\\n<blockquote><ol>\\r\\n<li>Accessories\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Printers<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Scanners<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Keyboards and Mice<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Computers\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Portables<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type: none;\\\">\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Large-screen portables<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Computers<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li style=\\\"list-style-type: none;\\\">\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Office Computers<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Professional Computers<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol><\\/blockquote>\\r\\n<p>In addition, the products presented in the table below are defined in the currency of the installed chart of accounts.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<table class=\\\"table\\\"><caption>Examples of products with their different prices<\\/caption>\\r\\n<thead>\\r\\n<tr class=\\\"row-odd\\\"><th>Product<\\/th><th>Sale Price<\\/th><th>Cost Price<\\/th><th>Default supplier price<\\/th><\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/thead>\\r\\n<tbody>\\r\\n<tr class=\\\"row-even\\\">\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s9925ccaaceea4b80826821aeb12e392b\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">Acclo Portable<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"see92c703bdf84203a2f9e787c8e011d6\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">1,200<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s8a526c19d94a42a993bd595a6d56a1b2\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">887<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"sa5e96ac7da734449adde6914f782ae84\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">893<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr class=\\\"row-odd\\\">\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"sca0d03d95e9a4f4b93f0deb096835d81\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">Toshibishi Portable<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s79fefc16709f4a519a22d649280927ae\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">1,340<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"sc3e6a2b0344745d6a140e5101533e8a9\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">920<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s15ec6782992c4f7193e505c075761fd0\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">920<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr class=\\\"row-even\\\">\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s0584dc0af9d84ebaa5f3e78580d48789\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">Berrel Keyboard<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s01fc1a43dde045bbaae72725d36406fe\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">100<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s871f9a7a4b554aa18234f9173d5d1277\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">50<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s2e75d6e02b9c433385ed702995d682aa\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">50<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<tr class=\\\"row-odd\\\">\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"sc458ad40379f45fdbfb6bd3e62ca2600\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">Office Computer<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s4373fecf8af2485f9eb1e5da4ee3ab62\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">1,400<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"sf03e70970abd4d88af8e5b33f3188872\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">1,000<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>\\r\\n<p id=\\\"s9104a0465538450682f0cbcb3e6b3023\\\" class=\\\"first last sphinx-has-comment\\\">1,000<\\/p>\\r\\n<\\/td>\\r\\n<td>&nbsp;<\\/td>\\r\\n<\\/tr>\\r\\n<\\/tbody>\\r\\n<\\/table>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Default Price Lists<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/product_pricelist_default.png\\\" alt=\\\"product pricelist default\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Default pricelist after installing Odoo<code><\\/code><\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you install the software, two pricelists are created by default: one for sales and one for purchases.

The effect of a delivery depends on the configuration of the sold product.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If its type is either <code>Stockable Product<\\/code> or <code>Consumable<\\/code>, Odoo will make a request for it to be sent for picking. If the product\'s type is <code>Service<\\/code>, Odoo\'s scheduler will create a task in the project management system, or create a subcontract purchase order if the product\'s Routes is <code>Make to Order<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Invoicing after delivery does as it says: invoicing for the services when the tasks have been closed.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When you sign a new contract, you can just enter the order into the system and Odoo will track the order.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This works well for small orders. But for large valued service orders, you might want to invoice several times through the contract, for example:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>30% on order,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>40% on completion,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>30% one month after the system has gone into production.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>In this case you should create several invoices for the one Sales Order. You have to do for this:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Do not handle invoicing automatically from the Sales Order but carry out manual invoicing instead.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"cost\\\">Cost-reimbursement Contracts<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Some contracts are not invoiced from a price fixed on the order but from the cost of the services carried out. That is usually what happens in the building sector or in large projects.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The approach you use for this is totally different because instead of using the sales order as the basis of the invoice you use the analytic accounts. For this you have to install the module <code>hr_timesheet_invoice<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>An analytic account is created for each new contract. The following fields must be completed in this analytic account:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Partner<\\/code>: partner associated with the contract,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Sale Pricelist<\\/code><\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Invoicing<code><\\/code><\\/code><\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>The selection of an invoicing rate is an indirect way of specifying that the project will be invoiced on the basis of analytic costs. This can take different forms, such as delivery of services, purchase of raw materials, and expense reimbursements.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Pricelists and Billing Rates<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>You can select a pricelist on the analytic account without having to use it to specify billing rates.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>An example of this is a client project that is to be invoiced only indirectly from the analytic costs. Putting the pricelist on the analytic account makes it possible to compare the actual sales with a best case situation where all the services would be invoiced. To get this comparison you have to print the analytic balance from the analytic account.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Project Management and Analytic Accounts<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Analytic Accounts is only available once you have installed the module <code>account_analytic_analysis<\\/code>. It provides various global financial and operational views of a project manager\'s projects.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"invoiced\\\">Fixed-price Contracts Invoiced as Services are Worked<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>For large-valued projects, fixed-price invoicing based on the sales order is not always appropriate. In the case of a services project planned to run for about six months, invoicing could be based on the following:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>30% on order,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>30% at the project mid-point,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>40% at delivery.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Such an approach is often used in a company but there are other options. This method of invoicing can pose many problems for the organization and invoicing of the project:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>It is extremely difficult to determine if the project is on track or not. The endpoint is fuzzy, which can result in a tricky discussion with the client at the moment of final invoicing.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>If the project takes more or less time than forecast, it will effectively result in under- or over-invoicing during the project.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Whether you get a proper return can depend on the client. For example, if the client takes a long time to sign off on project acceptance, you cannot invoice the remaining 40% even though you might have supplied the agreed service properly.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The account manager and the project manager are often different people. The project manager has to alert the account manager about the moment that the client can be invoiced, but that moment can easily be forgotten or mistaken.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>The project can be fixed for service costs but have agreed extras, such as reimbursement for travel expenses. Invoicing from the order does not adapt well to such an approach.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>Odoo provides a third method for invoicing services that can be useful on long projects. This consists of invoicing the project periodically on the basis of time worked up to a fixed amount that cannot be exceeded. At the end of the project, a final invoice or a credit note is generated to meet the total amount of value fixed for the project.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To configure such a project you must set an invoicing rate, a pricelist and a maximum amount on the analytic account for the project. The services are then invoiced throughout the project by the different project or account managers, just like projects that are invoiced by time used. The managers can apply a refund on the final invoice if the project takes more time to complete than permitted under the contract.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When the project is finished you can generate the closing invoice. This automatically calculates the final balance of the bill, taking the amounts already charged into account. If the amount already invoiced is greater than the maximum agreed amount, then Odoo generates a draft credit note.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This approach offers many advantages compared with the traditional methods of invoicing in phases for fixed-price contracts:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Fixed-price contracts and cost-reimbursable contracts are invoiced in the same way, which makes the company\'s invoicing process quite simple and systematic even when the projects are mixed.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Everything is invoiced on the basis of worked time, making it easy to forecast invoicing from plans linked to the different analytical accounts.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>This method of proceeding educates project managers just as much as the client because refunds have to be given for work done if the project slips.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Invoicing follows the course of the project and avoids a supplier\'s dependence on the goodwill of the client in approving certain phases.<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Invoicing of expenses follows the same workflow and is therefore very simple.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>In contract negotiation, invoicing conditions are often neglected by the client. So it can often be straightforward to apply this method of invoicing.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"limit\\\">Contracts Limited to a Quantity<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Finally, certain contracts are expressed in terms of a quantity rather than a fixed amount. Support contracts comprising a number of prepaid hours are a case in point. To generate such contracts in Odoo you should start by installing the module <code>account_analytic_analysis<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Then you can set a maximum number of hours for each analytic account. When employees enter their time worked on the support contract in the timesheets, the hours are automatically deducted from the maximum set on each analytic account.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You must also name someone in the company responsible for renewing expired contracts. They become responsible for searching through the list of accounts showing negative remaining hours.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The client contract can be limited to a certain quantity of hours, and it can also be limited in time.

It then opens that or the generated invoices (in the case of creating invoices for several receipts at one time) which enables you to modify it before confirming it.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>This approach is useful when you receive the invoice at the same time as the item from the supplier. Usually, invoices are sent by post some days later. In this case, the storesperson leaves the item unchanged without generating an invoice. Then, once per day or once per week the accountant will create the draft invoices based on all the receipts for the day. To do that, he uses the menu <code>Purchases &gt; Invoice Control &gt; On Draft Invoices<\\/code>. He clicks the action <code>Validate<\\/code> to generate all draft invoices from the list of receipts that have not yet been invoiced.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>At that point, the accountant can decide if he wants to generate an invoice per item or group all items for the same partner into the same invoice.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Invoices are then handled just like those controlled from <code>On Order<\\/code>. Once the invoice arrives at the accounting service, he just compares it with the invoices waiting to control what the supplier invoices you.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To manage delivery charges, install the module delivery from <code>Settings<\\/code> menu. This will automatically add delivery charges to the creation of the draft invoice as a function of the products delivered or ordered.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"tender\\\">Tenders<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>To manage tenders, you should use the module <code>purchase_requisition<\\/code>, you can install this module direct from <code>Settings<\\/code> menu or you can select <code>Manage calls for bids<\\/code> option from configuration of <code>Purchases<\\/code> in <code>Settings<\\/code> menu . This lets you create several supplier price requests for a single supply requirement. Once the module is installed, Odoo adds a new Calls for Bids menu in <code>Purchases &gt; Purchase<\\/code>. You can then define the new tenders.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img src=\\\"images\\/documents\\/purchase_tender.png\\\" alt=\\\"purchase tender\\\" class=\\\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\\\" \\/><\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><em><code>Defining a Tender<\\/code><\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To enter data for a new tender, use the menu <code>Purchases &gt; Purchase &gt; Calls for Bids<\\/code> and select Create. Odoo then opens a new blank tender form. The reference number is set by default and you can enter information about your tender in the other fields.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>If you want to enter a supplier\'s response to your tender request, add a new draft purchase order into the list on the Quotation of your tender document. If you want to revise a supplier price in response to negotiations, edit any appropriate purchase order that you have left in the draft state and link that to the tender.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>When one of the orders about a tender is confirmed, all of the other orders are automatically cancelled by Odoo if you selected the <code>Select only one RFQ (exclusive)<\\/code> type. That enables you to accept just one order for a particular tender. If you select <code>Select multiple RFQ<\\/code>, you can approve several purchase orders without cancelling other orders from this tender.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2><a name=\\\"pricing\\\">Price Revisions<\\/a><\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>Odoo supports several methods of calculating and automatically updating product costs:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li><code>Standard Price<\\/code>: manually fixed, and revalued automatically and periodically,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li><code>Average Price<\\/code>: updated at each receipt to the warehouse.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>This cost is used to value your stock and represents your product costs. Included in that cost is everything directly related to the received cost. You could include such elements as:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>supplier price,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>delivery charges,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>manufacturing costs,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>storage charges.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<h3>Standard Price<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>The mode of price management for the product is shown in the tab <code>Procurements<\\/code> on the product form. On each individual product, you can select if you want to work in <code>Standard Price<\\/code> or on weighted <code>Average Price<\\/code>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The <code>Standard Price<\\/code> setting means that the product cost is fixed manually for each product in the field <code>Cost Price<\\/code>. This is usually revalued once a year based on the average of purchase costs or manufacturing costs.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>You usually use standard costs to manage products where the price hardly changes over the course of the year. For example, the standard cost could be used to manage books, or the cost of bread.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Those costs that can be fixed for the whole year bring certain advantages:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>you can base the sale price on the product cost and then work with margins rather than a fixed price per product,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>accounting is simplified because there is a direct relationship between the value of stock and the number of items received.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>To get an automated periodic revaluation of the standard price you can use the action Update on the product form, enabling you to update prices of all the selected products. Odoo then recalculates the price of the products as a function of the cost of raw materials and the manufacturing operations given in the routing.<\\/p>\\r\\n<h3>Average Price<\\/h3>\\r\\n<p>Working with standard prices does not lend itself well to the management of the cost price of products when the prices change a lot with the state of the market. This is the case for many commodities and energy.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In this case, you would want Odoo to automatically set the price in response to each goods receipt movement into the warehouse. The deliveries (exit from stock) have no impact on the product price.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>At each goods receipt, the product price is recalculated using the following accounting formula: NP = (OP * QS + PP * QR) \\/ (QS + QR), where the following notation is used:<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>NP: New Price,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>OP: Old Price,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>QS: Quantity actually in Stock,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>PP: Price Paid for the quantity received,<\\/li>\\r\\n<li>QR: Quantity Received.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>If the products are managed as a weighted average, Odoo will open a window that lets you specify the price of the product received at each goods receipt. The purchase price is, by default, set from the purchase order, but you can change the price to add the cost of delivery to the various received products.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Once the receipt has been confirmed, the price is automatically recalculated and entered on the product form.&nbsp;<\\/p>\",\"state\":1,\"catid\":\"30\",\"created\":\"2015-08-10
