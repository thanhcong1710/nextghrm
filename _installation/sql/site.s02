Ideally the product should be configured with Product Type <code>Service</code>.</p>\r\n<p>You can use the same product for several delivery modes. This simplifies the configuration, but it has the disadvantage that you will not be able to separate your sales figures by delivery mode.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"grid\">Tariff Grids</a></h2>\r\n<p>Unlike ordinary products, delivery prices are not proposed through pricelists but through delivery grids, designed specifically for this purpose. For each delivery mode, you enter one or several tariff grids. Each grid is used for a given region/destination.</p>\r\n<p>For example, for the postal tariffs for Priority Courier, you generally define the three tariff grids for Mail Office:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>National Courier,</li>\r\n<li>Courier in Europe,</li>\r\n<li>Courier Outside Europe.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To define a new delivery grid, use the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Configuration &gt; Delivery &gt; Delivery Pricelist</code>. Give a name to your delivery grid and define the region for which the tariffs in the grid will apply in the second tab <code>Destination</code>. There you can set:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A list of countries (for UK or Europe, for example),</li>\r\n<li>A list of states,</li>\r\n<li>A range of postal codes (for Paris you might have 75000 – 75900).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Then you have to set the rules for calculating the transport price in the first tab <code>Grid definition</code>. First of all, give the rule a name. Then set the condition for which this rule is applicable, for example Weight &lt; 0.5kg.</p>\r\n<p>Weights are always expressed in kilograms. You can define a number with a decimal point or comma, so to set 500g you would put 0.5 in the weight rule.</p>\r\n<p>Next you can set the sales price and the cost price. Prices can be expressed in various ways:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a fixed price,</li>\r\n<li>a variable price, as a function of weight, volume, weight x volume or price.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For example, mailing within France using current tariffs would be defined as shown in the table below:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Example Tariff Rules</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr><th>Name</th><th>Condition</th><th>Price</th><th>Price Type</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>S</td>\r\n<td>Weight &lt; 3 kg</td>\r\n<td>6.90</td>\r\n<td>Fixed</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>M</td>\r\n<td>Weight &lt; 5 kg</td>\r\n<td>7.82</td>\r\n<td>Fixed</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>L</td>\r\n<td>Weight &lt; 6 kg</td>\r\n<td>8.53</td>\r\n<td>Fixed</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>XL</td>\r\n<td>Weight &lt; 7 kg</td>\r\n<td>9.87</td>\r\n<td>Fixed</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>You can also define rules that depend on the total amount on the order. For example to offer fixed price delivery if the total order amount is greater than 150 USD, add the following rule:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Additional Tariff Rule</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr><th>Name</th><th>Condition</th><th>Price</th><th>Price Type</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Franked &gt; 150 USD</td>\r\n<td>Price &gt; 150 USD</td>\r\n<td>10</td>\r\n<td>Fixed</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"mode\">Delivery Modes</a></h2>\r\n<p>Once the delivery modes and their corresponding tariffs have been defined, you can use them in a Sales Order.

You can change that to <code>Average Price</code>, meaning that the product cost fluctuates with purchases from suppliers. After product receipt you can include fixed costs, such as delivery costs, in the cost of each product.</p>\r\n<p>Odoo supports a third method of updating the cost price of products. This is through the button Update on the product form which lets you automatically recalculate the cost price for the selected product. The cost price is calculated from the raw materials and the operations carried out (if the products have been manufactured internally, so that you have set their costs).</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"product\">Margins by Product</a></h2>\r\n<p>To track margins by product, install the module <code>product_margin</code>.

Many forms of price variation are used, such as end-of-year refunds, discounts, change of terms and conditions with time, various prepayments, cascaded rebates, seasonal promotions, and progressive price reductions.</p>\r\n', '\r\n<p>In some accounting jurisdictions you have to differentiate between the three following terms:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Rebate: reimbursement to the client, usually at the end of the year, that depends on the quantity of goods purchased over a period.</li>\r\n<li>Refund: reduction on the order line or invoice line if a certain quantity of goods is purchased at one time or is sold in a framework of a promotional activity.</li>\r\n<li>Reduction: a one-off reduction resulting from a quality defect or a variation in a product\'s conformance to a specification.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Intelligent price management is difficult, because it requires you to integrate several conditions from clients and suppliers to create estimates quickly or to invoice automatically. But if you have an efficient price management mechanism you can often keep margins raised and respond quickly to changes in market conditions. A good price management system gives you scope for varying any and all of the relevant factors when you are negotiating a contract.</p>\r\n<p>To help you work most effectively, Odoo\'s pricelist principles are extremely powerful yet are based on simple and generic rules. You can develop both sales pricelists and purchase pricelists for products capable of accommodating conditions such as the date period, the quantity requested and the type of product.</p>\r\n<p>Do not confuse the sales price with the basic price of the product. In Odoo\'s basic configuration, the sales price is the list price specified in the product form, but a customer can have a different sales price depending on the conditions.</p>\r\n<p>The same applies to the purchase price and standard cost. Purchase price is your suppliers\' selling price, which changes in response to different criteria such as quantities, dates, and supplier. This is automatically set by the accounting system. You will find that the two prices have been set by default to the same for all products with the demonstration data, which can be a source of confusion. You are free to set the standard cost to something different.</p>\r\n<p>Each pricelist is calculated from defined policies, so you will have as many sales pricelists as active sales policies in the company. For example, a company that sells products through three sales channels could create the following price lists:</p>\r\n<blockquote><ol>\r\n<li>Main distribution:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pricelist for Walbury</li>\r\n<li>Pricelist for TesMart</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Postal Sales.</li>\r\n<li>Walk-in customers.</li>\r\n</ol></blockquote>\r\n<p>A single pricelist can exist in several versions, only one of which is permitted to be active at a given time. These versions let you set different prices at different points in time. So the pricelist for walk-in customers could have five different versions, for example: <code>Autumn</code>, <code>Summer</code>, <code>Summer Sales</code>, <code>Winter</code>, <code>Spring</code>. Direct customers will see prices that change with the seasons.</p>\r\n<p>Each pricelist is expressed in a single currency. If your company sells products in several currencies, you will have to create as many pricelists as you have currencies.</p>\r\n<p>The prices on a pricelist can depend on another list, which means that you do not have to repeat the definition of all conditions for each product. So a pricelist in USD can be based on a pricelist in EUR. If the currency conversion rates between EUR and USD change, or the EUR prices change, the USD rates can be automatically adjusted.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"create\">Creating Price Lists</a></h2>\r\n<p>You can define a pricelist from the menu <code>Sales &gt; Configuration &gt; Pricelists &gt; Pricelists</code>.</p>\r\n<p>For each list you should define:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a <code>Name</code> for the list,</li>\r\n<li>a <code>Type</code> of list: Sale for customers or Purchase for suppliers,</li>\r\n<li>the <code>Currency</code> in which the prices are expressed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Price List Versions</h3>\r\n<p>Once the pricelist is defined you have to link at least one version. You can create a new version directly from the pricelist or from the <code>Sales &gt; Configuration &gt; Pricelists &gt; Pricelist Versions</code> menu. The version contains all of the rules that enable you to calculate a price for a product and a given quantity.</p>\r\n<p>Start by setting the Name of this associated version. If the list only has a single version, you can use the same name for the pricelist and the version. In the <code>Price List</code> field, select the pricelist you created (this is not necessary if you create the version directly from the pricelist).</p>\r\n<p>Then set the <code>Start Date</code> and <code>End Date</code> of this version. The fields are both optional: if you do not set any dates the version will be permanently active. Only one version may be active at any one point, so bear this in mind when creating them. Use the Active field in the versions to activate or disable a pricelist version.</p>\r\n<p>Any sales pricelist can be set to depend on one of the other pricelists. So you could create your sales pricelist based on the supplier\'s purchase pricelist, to which you add a margin. The prices are automatically calculated as a function of the purchase price and need no further manual adjustment.</p>\r\n<h3>Calculation Rules</h3>\r\n<p>A pricelist version is made up of a set of rules that apply to the basic product prices.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/service_pricelist_line.png\" alt=\"service pricelist line\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Rule in a Pricelist Version</code></em></p>\r\n<p>You define the conditions for a rule . The rule applies to the <code>Product</code> or <code>Product Template</code> and/or the named <code>Product Category</code>. If a rule is applied to a category, then it is automatically applied to all of its subcategories too (using the tree structure for product categories).</p>\r\n<p>If you set a minimum quantity in <code>Min. Quantity</code>, the rule will only apply to a quantity equal to or larger than the quantity set. This way, you can define reduced rates in steps according to the quantities ordered.</p>\r\n<p>Several rules can be applied to an order. Odoo evaluates these rules by sequence number, to determine which rule(s) to apply to the specified price calculation. If several rules are valid, only the first in sequence is used for the calculation. The <code>Sequence</code> field determines the order, starting with the lowest number and working up.</p>\r\n<p>Once a rule has been selected, the system has to determine how to calculate the price from the rule. This operation is based on the criteria set out in the lower part of the form, labelled Price Computation.</p>\r\n<p>The first field to complete is <code>Based on</code>. Set the way in which the partner price will be calculated, choosing between:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the <code>Public Price</code> set in the product file,</li>\r\n<li>the <code>Cost Price</code> set in the product file,</li>\r\n<li>an <code>Other Pricelist</code> given in the field If Other Pricelist</li>\r\n<li>the price that varies as a function of a supplier defined in the Supplier Prices on the product form</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Several other criteria can be considered and added to the list, as you will see in the following section.</p>\r\n<p>Next, various operations can be applied to the basic price to calculate the sales or purchase price for the partner, according to the specified quantities. To calculate it, you apply the formula shown on the form: <code>Price = Base Price x (1 + Field1) + Field2</code>.</p>\r\n<p>The first field, <code>Field1</code>, defines a discount or a supplement. Set it to -0.20 for a discount of 20% from the basic price. If your price is based on standard cost, you can set 0.15 to get a 15% price uplift compared to the standard costs.</p>\r\n<p><code>Field2</code> sets a fixed supplement to the price, expressed in the currency of the pricelist. This amount is just added (or subtracted, if negative) to the amount calculated with the <code>Field1</code> discount.</p>\r\n<p>Then you can specify a rounding method. The rounding calculation is carried out to the nearest number. For example if you set 0.05 in this example, a price of 45.66 will be rounded to 45.65, and 14,567 rounded to 100 will give a price of 14,600.</p>\r\n<p>In Switzerland, the smallest monetary unit is 5 cents. There are not any 1 or 2 cent coins. So you set Odoo\'s rounding to 0.05 to round everything in a Swiss franc pricelist.</p>\r\n<p>The supplement from <code>Field2</code> is applied before the rounding calculation, which enables some interesting effects. For example, if you want all your prices to end in 9.99, set your rounding to 10 and your supplement to -0.01 in <code>Field2</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Minimum and Maximum margins enable you to guarantee a given margin over the base price. A margin of 10 USD enables you to stop the discount from returning less than that margin. If you put 0 into this field, no effect is taken into account.</p>\r\n<p>Once the pricelist is defined, you can assign it to a customer. Go to the Customer form and select its <code>Sales &amp; Purchases</code> tab. You can then change the <code>Purchase Pricelist</code> and the <code>Sale Pricelist</code> that is loaded by default for the customer.</p>\r\n<h3>Decimal Accuracy</h3>\r\n<p>There are several configuration settings related to the decimal accuracy of prices, or the number of decimal places to hold with each price field. To change the accuracy of a field, follow these steps:</p>\r\n<p>First make sure that you have give the access rights to user.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Go to <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Database Structure &gt; Decimal Accuracy</code>.

Otherwise it uses the rule above.</li>\r\n<li>Assume that the Acclo pricelist is defined in Odoo.

In such a case, the contract is represented by a pricelist for that specific customer.</p>\r\n<p>The pricelist is linked in the <code>Sales and Purchases</code> tab of the Customers form, so that it is brought up whenever anything is bought from or sold to this partner (depending on whether it is a purchase or sales agreement). Odoo automatically selects the price based on this agreed pricelist.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"fixedprice\">Fixed Price Contracts</a></h2>\r\n<p>Fixed price contracts for the sale of services are represented in Odoo by a <code>Sales Order</code>. In this case, the supply of services is managed just like all other stockable or consumable products.</p>\r\n<p>You can add new orders using the menu <code>Sales &gt; Sales &gt; Quotations</code>.</p>\r\n<p>The new <code>Sales Order</code> document starts in the <code>Draft Quotation</code> state, so the estimate has no accounting impact on the system until it is confirmed.

Once this is confirmed and paid, the delivery is activated.</li>\r\n<li><code>Invoice on Order After Delivery</code>: the delivery order is produced when the order is validated. A draft invoice is then created when the delivery has been completed.</li>\r\n<li><code>Shipping &amp; Manual Invoice</code>: Odoo starts the delivery from the confirmation of the order, and adds a button which you manually click when you are ready to create an invoice.</li>\r\n<li><code>Invoice From The Delivery</code>: invoices are created from the picking stage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The term \'delivery\' should be taken in the broadest sense in Odoo. The effect of a delivery depends on the configuration of the sold product.</p>\r\n<p>If its type is either <code>Stockable Product</code> or <code>Consumable</code>, Odoo will make a request for it to be sent for picking. If the product\'s type is <code>Service</code>, Odoo\'s scheduler will create a task in the project management system, or create a subcontract purchase order if the product\'s Routes is <code>Make to Order</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Invoicing after delivery does as it says: invoicing for the services when the tasks have been closed.</p>\r\n<p>When you sign a new contract, you can just enter the order into the system and Odoo will track the order.</p>\r\n<p>This works well for small orders. But for large valued service orders, you might want to invoice several times through the contract, for example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>30% on order,</li>\r\n<li>40% on completion,</li>\r\n<li>30% one month after the system has gone into production.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In this case you should create several invoices for the one Sales Order. You have to do for this:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do not handle invoicing automatically from the Sales Order but carry out manual invoicing instead.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><a name=\"cost\">Cost-reimbursement Contracts</a></h2>\r\n<p>Some contracts are not invoiced from a price fixed on the order but from the cost of the services carried out. That is usually what happens in the building sector or in large projects.</p>\r\n<p>The approach you use for this is totally different because instead of using the sales order as the basis of the invoice you use the analytic accounts. For this you have to install the module <code>hr_timesheet_invoice</code>.</p>\r\n<p>An analytic account is created for each new contract. The following fields must be completed in this analytic account:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Partner</code>: partner associated with the contract,</li>\r\n<li><code>Sale Pricelist</code></li>\r\n<li><code>Invoicing<code></code></code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The selection of an invoicing rate is an indirect way of specifying that the project will be invoiced on the basis of analytic costs. This can take different forms, such as delivery of services, purchase of raw materials, and expense reimbursements.</p>\r\n<h3>Pricelists and Billing Rates</h3>\r\n<p>You can select a pricelist on the analytic account without having to use it to specify billing rates.</p>\r\n<p>An example of this is a client project that is to be invoiced only indirectly from the analytic costs. Putting the pricelist on the analytic account makes it possible to compare the actual sales with a best case situation where all the services would be invoiced. To get this comparison you have to print the analytic balance from the analytic account.</p>\r\n<h3>Project Management and Analytic Accounts</h3>\r\n<p>Analytic Accounts is only available once you have installed the module <code>account_analytic_analysis</code>. It provides various global financial and operational views of a project manager\'s projects.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"invoiced\">Fixed-price Contracts Invoiced as Services are Worked</a></h2>\r\n<p>For large-valued projects, fixed-price invoicing based on the sales order is not always appropriate. In the case of a services project planned to run for about six months, invoicing could be based on the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>30% on order,</li>\r\n<li>30% at the project mid-point,</li>\r\n<li>40% at delivery.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Such an approach is often used in a company but there are other options. This method of invoicing can pose many problems for the organization and invoicing of the project:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is extremely difficult to determine if the project is on track or not. The endpoint is fuzzy, which can result in a tricky discussion with the client at the moment of final invoicing.</li>\r\n<li>If the project takes more or less time than forecast, it will effectively result in under- or over-invoicing during the project.</li>\r\n<li>Whether you get a proper return can depend on the client. For example, if the client takes a long time to sign off on project acceptance, you cannot invoice the remaining 40% even though you might have supplied the agreed service properly.</li>\r\n<li>The account manager and the project manager are often different people. The project manager has to alert the account manager about the moment that the client can be invoiced, but that moment can easily be forgotten or mistaken.</li>\r\n<li>The project can be fixed for service costs but have agreed extras, such as reimbursement for travel expenses. Invoicing from the order does not adapt well to such an approach.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Odoo provides a third method for invoicing services that can be useful on long projects. This consists of invoicing the project periodically on the basis of time worked up to a fixed amount that cannot be exceeded. At the end of the project, a final invoice or a credit note is generated to meet the total amount of value fixed for the project.</p>\r\n<p>To configure such a project you must set an invoicing rate, a pricelist and a maximum amount on the analytic account for the project. The services are then invoiced throughout the project by the different project or account managers, just like projects that are invoiced by time used. The managers can apply a refund on the final invoice if the project takes more time to complete than permitted under the contract.</p>\r\n<p>When the project is finished you can generate the closing invoice. This automatically calculates the final balance of the bill, taking the amounts already charged into account. If the amount already invoiced is greater than the maximum agreed amount, then Odoo generates a draft credit note.</p>\r\n<p>This approach offers many advantages compared with the traditional methods of invoicing in phases for fixed-price contracts:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fixed-price contracts and cost-reimbursable contracts are invoiced in the same way, which makes the company\'s invoicing process quite simple and systematic even when the projects are mixed.</li>\r\n<li>Everything is invoiced on the basis of worked time, making it easy to forecast invoicing from plans linked to the different analytical accounts.</li>\r\n<li>This method of proceeding educates project managers just as much as the client because refunds have to be given for work done if the project slips.</li>\r\n<li>Invoicing follows the course of the project and avoids a supplier\'s dependence on the goodwill of the client in approving certain phases.</li>\r\n<li>Invoicing of expenses follows the same workflow and is therefore very simple.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In contract negotiation, invoicing conditions are often neglected by the client. So it can often be straightforward to apply this method of invoicing.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"limit\">Contracts Limited to a Quantity</a></h2>\r\n<p>Finally, certain contracts are expressed in terms of a quantity rather than a fixed amount. Support contracts comprising a number of prepaid hours are a case in point. To generate such contracts in Odoo you should start by installing the module <code>account_analytic_analysis</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Then you can set a maximum number of hours for each analytic account. When employees enter their time worked on the support contract in the timesheets, the hours are automatically deducted from the maximum set on each analytic account.</p>\r\n<p>You must also name someone in the company responsible for renewing expired contracts. They become responsible for searching through the list of accounts showing negative remaining hours.</p>\r\n<p>The client contract can be limited to a certain quantity of hours, and it can also be limited in time. For that, you set an end date for the corresponding analytic account.</p>', '1', '29', '2015-08-10 04:15:56', '836', '', '2015-08-10 04:26:31', '836', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-08-10 04:15:56', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}', '2', '8', '', 'Contracts can take different forms within Odoo, depending on their nature.

If you do that, Odoo will then use those details instead of your own internal product names for that selected supplier.</p>\r\n<p>If you work with management by case, you can also set the analytic account that should be used to report all the purchase costs. The costs will then be reported at the receipt of the supplier invoice.</p>\r\n<p>Analytic accounts can be very useful for all companies that manage costs by case, by site, by project or by folder. To work with several analytic axes, you should install the module <code>purchase_analytic_plans</code>,from <code>Settings</code> menu.</p>\r\n<p>To make sure that the analytic account is automatically selected according to the partner, the date, the products or the user, you can install the module <code>account_analytic_default</code> (which is installed automatically as a dependency of <code>purchase_analytic_plans</code>).</p>\r\n<p>In the <code>Purchase Order</code> tab below the product line, you can enter a note that will be attached when the order confirmation or price quotation is printed. This note can be predefined on the product form to automatically appear on each order for that product. For example, you can enter “Do not forget to send by express delivery as specified in our contract reference 1234.”</p>\r\n<p>Once the document has been completed, you can print it by clicking <code>Print</code> button on the form.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/purchase_quotation.png\" alt=\"purchase quotation\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Printing the Supplier Price Quotation</code></em></p>\r\n<p>You can also send an e-mail by clicking <code>Send by Email</code> button on the form . Now it will be in the <code>RFQ</code> state.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/RFQ_sent.png\" alt=\"RFQ sent\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Quotation after sending an e-mail in RFQ State</code></em></p>\r\n<p>When you receive a response from the supplier, use the menu <code>Purchases &gt; Purchase &gt; Requests for Quotation</code>. Select the order and complete its details.</p>\r\n<p>When you want to approve the order, use the button <code>Confirm Order</code>. The price request then passes into the <code>Purchase Confirmed</code> state. No further changes are possible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/purchase_process.png\" alt=\"purchase process\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Purchase Order Process</code></em></p>\r\n<h3>Goods Receipt</h3>\r\n<p>Once the order has been approved, Odoo automatically prepares the goods receipt order in the draft state for you. To get a list of the products you are waiting for from your suppliers, use the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Operations &gt; All Operations</code>, and click <code>Your Company: Receipts</code>.</p>\r\n<p>If you buy services from your supplier, Odoo does not generate a goods receipt note. There is no service receipt equivalent to a goods receipt.</p>\r\n<p>Select the document that corresponds to the item that you are receiving. Usually, the goods receipt note is found by making a search on the order reference or the supplier name. You can then confirm the receipt of the products.</p>\r\n<p>As described in <code>Your Warehouse</code>, if you receive only part of the order, Odoo manages the remainder of that order. A second receipt note is then automatically created for the goods not received. You can cancel it if you think that you will never receive the remaining products.</p>\r\n<p>After receiving the goods, Odoo will show you which orders are open and the state of their receipt and invoicing if you return to the list of orders.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/purchase_list.png\" alt=\"purchase list\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>List view of Purchase Orders</code></em></p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"invoicing\">Control of Invoicing</a></h2>\r\n<p>To control supplier invoicing, Odoo provides three systems as standard, which can differ order by order:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Based on Purchase Order lines</code>: place individual lines in \'Invoice Control &gt; Based on P.O. lines\' from where you can selectively create an invoice,</li>\r\n<li><code>Based on generated draft invoice</code>: create a draft invoice you can validate later,</li>\r\n<li><code>Bases on incoming shipments</code>:let you create an invoice when receptions are validated.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The mode of invoicing control is set in the second tab <code>Deliveries &amp; Invoices</code> of the purchase order in the field <code>Invoicing Control</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/purchase_form_tab2.png\" alt=\"purchase form tab2\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Purchase Order, Invoice Control</code></em></p>\r\n<p>A company generally uses a single invoicing control method for all of its invoices. So you are advised to set a default value in the <code>Invoicing Control</code> field after installation.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"baseonorder\">Control based on Orders</a></h2>\r\n<p>If you selected your invoicing control based on orders, Odoo will automatically generate a supplier invoice in the draft state when the order is confirmed. You can obtain a list of invoices waiting using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Suppliers &gt; Supplier Invoices</code> and enabling the <code>Draft</code> filter.</p>\r\n<p>When you receive a paper invoice from your supplier, all you need to do is validate the invoice pre- generated by the system. Do not forget to check the price and the quantities. When the invoice is confirmed, the accounting entries represent the cost of purchase and are automatically entered into the system.</p>\r\n<p>The supplier order is automatically set as <code>Paid</code> when you pay the supplier invoice.</p>\r\n<p>This method of controlling invoices is often used in service companies, because the invoiced amounts correspond to the ordered amounts. In logistics, by contrast, you most often work with invoicing controlled by goods receipt.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"baseonreceipt\">Control based on Goods Receipt</a></h2>\r\n<p>To control your supplier invoices based on goods receipt, set the field <code>Invoicing Control</code> on the second tab of the order to <code>Based on incoming shipments</code>.</p>\r\n<p>In this case, no invoice, draft state or any other, is generated by the order. On the goods receipt note, the field <code>Invoice Control</code> is set to <code>To Be Invoiced</code>.</p>\r\n<p>The storesperson can then receive different orders. If he wants to generate the draft invoice for a goods receipt, he can click the action <code>Create Invoice</code>. Odoo then asks you for the journal for this invoice. It then opens that or the generated invoices (in the case of creating invoices for several receipts at one time) which enables you to modify it before confirming it.</p>\r\n<p>This approach is useful when you receive the invoice at the same time as the item from the supplier. Usually, invoices are sent by post some days later. In this case, the storesperson leaves the item unchanged without generating an invoice. Then, once per day or once per week the accountant will create the draft invoices based on all the receipts for the day. To do that, he uses the menu <code>Purchases &gt; Invoice Control &gt; On Draft Invoices</code>. He clicks the action <code>Validate</code> to generate all draft invoices from the list of receipts that have not yet been invoiced.</p>\r\n<p>At that point, the accountant can decide if he wants to generate an invoice per item or group all items for the same partner into the same invoice.</p>\r\n<p>Invoices are then handled just like those controlled from <code>On Order</code>. Once the invoice arrives at the accounting service, he just compares it with the invoices waiting to control what the supplier invoices you.</p>\r\n<p>To manage delivery charges, install the module delivery from <code>Settings</code> menu. This will automatically add delivery charges to the creation of the draft invoice as a function of the products delivered or ordered.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"tender\">Tenders</a></h2>\r\n<p>To manage tenders, you should use the module <code>purchase_requisition</code>, you can install this module direct from <code>Settings</code> menu or you can select <code>Manage calls for bids</code> option from configuration of <code>Purchases</code> in <code>Settings</code> menu . This lets you create several supplier price requests for a single supply requirement. Once the module is installed, Odoo adds a new Calls for Bids menu in <code>Purchases &gt; Purchase</code>. You can then define the new tenders.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/purchase_tender.png\" alt=\"purchase tender\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Defining a Tender</code></em></p>\r\n<p>To enter data for a new tender, use the menu <code>Purchases &gt; Purchase &gt; Calls for Bids</code> and select Create. Odoo then opens a new blank tender form. The reference number is set by default and you can enter information about your tender in the other fields.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to enter a supplier\'s response to your tender request, add a new draft purchase order into the list on the Quotation of your tender document. If you want to revise a supplier price in response to negotiations, edit any appropriate purchase order that you have left in the draft state and link that to the tender.</p>\r\n<p>When one of the orders about a tender is confirmed, all of the other orders are automatically cancelled by Odoo if you selected the <code>Select only one RFQ (exclusive)</code> type. That enables you to accept just one order for a particular tender. If you select <code>Select multiple RFQ</code>, you can approve several purchase orders without cancelling other orders from this tender.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"pricing\">Price Revisions</a></h2>\r\n<p>Odoo supports several methods of calculating and automatically updating product costs:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Standard Price</code>: manually fixed, and revalued automatically and periodically,</li>\r\n<li><code>Average Price</code>: updated at each receipt to the warehouse.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This cost is used to value your stock and represents your product costs. Included in that cost is everything directly related to the received cost. You could include such elements as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>supplier price,</li>\r\n<li>delivery charges,</li>\r\n<li>manufacturing costs,</li>\r\n<li>storage charges.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Standard Price</h3>\r\n<p>The mode of price management for the product is shown in the tab <code>Procurements</code> on the product form. On each individual product, you can select if you want to work in <code>Standard Price</code> or on weighted <code>Average Price</code>.</p>\r\n<p>The <code>Standard Price</code> setting means that the product cost is fixed manually for each product in the field <code>Cost Price</code>. This is usually revalued once a year based on the average of purchase costs or manufacturing costs.</p>\r\n<p>You usually use standard costs to manage products where the price hardly changes over the course of the year. For example, the standard cost could be used to manage books, or the cost of bread.</p>\r\n<p>Those costs that can be fixed for the whole year bring certain advantages:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>you can base the sale price on the product cost and then work with margins rather than a fixed price per product,</li>\r\n<li>accounting is simplified because there is a direct relationship between the value of stock and the number of items received.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To get an automated periodic revaluation of the standard price you can use the action Update on the product form, enabling you to update prices of all the selected products. Odoo then recalculates the price of the products as a function of the cost of raw materials and the manufacturing operations given in the routing.</p>\r\n<h3>Average Price</h3>\r\n<p>Working with standard prices does not lend itself well to the management of the cost price of products when the prices change a lot with the state of the market. This is the case for many commodities and energy.</p>\r\n<p>In this case, you would want Odoo to automatically set the price in response to each goods receipt movement into the warehouse. The deliveries (exit from stock) have no impact on the product price.</p>\r\n<p>At each goods receipt, the product price is recalculated using the following accounting formula: NP = (OP * QS + PP * QR) / (QS + QR), where the following notation is used:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>NP: New Price,</li>\r\n<li>OP: Old Price,</li>\r\n<li>QS: Quantity actually in Stock,</li>\r\n<li>PP: Price Paid for the quantity received,</li>\r\n<li>QR: Quantity Received.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If the products are managed as a weighted average, Odoo will open a window that lets you specify the price of the product received at each goods receipt. The purchase price is, by default, set from the purchase order, but you can change the price to add the cost of delivery to the various received products.</p>\r\n<p>Once the receipt has been confirmed, the price is automatically recalculated and entered on the product form.&nbsp;</p>', '1', '30', '2015-08-10 04:30:16', '836', '', '2015-08-10 23:38:25', '836', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-08-10 04:30:16', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}', '3', '1', '', 'The supplier or purchase order is the document that lets you manage price negotiations, control supplier invoices, handle goods receipts and synchronize all of these documents.', '1', '3904', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0', 'en-GB', ''), ('66', '219', 'Terms of Service', 'terms-of-service', '<p class=\"alert alert-info\"><strong>These Terms of Use are intended to explain our obligations as a service provider and Your obligations as a customer.

This is made possible through a search view accessed through the menu <code>Reporting &gt; Purchase &gt; Purchase Analysis</code>.</p>\r\n', '\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/purchase_report.png\" alt=\"purchase report\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Analysis of Purchases</code></em></p>\r\n<p>This analysis is carried out on supplier orders and not on invoices or the quantities actually received. To get an analysis by product, use the module <code>product_margin</code>. The function of this module is described in detail in <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=62:keep-track-of-your-margins&amp;catid=29:sales-management&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;Itemid=213\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sales Margins\">Sales Margins</a>.</p>\r\n<p>To analyze the received quantities, you can use the statistical reports in Warehouse.</p>\r\n<p>To manage purchases by project, you should use analytic accounts. You can set an analytic account on each line of a supplier order. The analytic costs linked to this purchase will be managed by Odoo from the goods receipt and confirmation of the supplier invoice.</p>\r\n<p>The <code>hr_timesheet_invoice</code> module lets you re-invoice the analytic costs automatically using parameters in the analytic accounts such as sale pricelist, associated partner company, and maximum amount.</p>\r\n<p>So you can put an invoice order with a defined invoice workflow in place based on the analytic accounts. If you are working <code>Make to Order</code>, the workflow will be:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Customer Order,</li>\r\n<li>Procurement Order on supplier,</li>\r\n<li>Receive invoice and goods from the supplier,</li>\r\n<li>Delivery and invoicing to the customer.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>When re-invoicing based on costs you would get the following workflow:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Enter the customer contract conditions from the analytic accounts,</li>\r\n<li>Purchase raw materials and write the services performed into the timesheets,</li>\r\n<li>Receive the supplier invoice and the products,</li>\r\n<li>Invoice these costs to the customer.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p class=\"alert alert-info\">If you want several analysis plans, you should install the module <code>purchase_analytic_plans</code>. These let you split a line on a supplier purchase order into several accounts and analytic plans.</p>\r\n<p>You need a common way of referring to each user, service, or document to integrate all your company\'s processes effectively. Such a common basis is provided by analytic accounts (or management accounts, or cost accounts, as they are also called) in Odoo.</p>\r\n<p>Analytic accounts are often presented as a foundation for strategic enterprise decisions. But because of all the information they pull together, Odoo\'s analytic accounts can be a useful management tool, at the center of most system processes.</p>\r\n<p>There are several reasons for this:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>they reflect your entire management activity,</li>\r\n<li>unlike the general accounts, the structure of the analytic accounts is not regulated by legal obligations, so each company can adapt it to its needs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In some software packages, analytic accounts are managed as an extension of general accounts – for example, by using the two last digits of the account code to represent analytic accounts.</p>\r\n<p>In Odoo, analytic accounts are linked to general accounts but are treated totally independently. So you can enter various different analytic operations that have no counterpart in the general financial accounts.</p>\r\n<p>While the structure of the general chart of accounts is imposed by law, the analytic chart of accounts is built to fit a company\'s needs closely.</p>\r\n<p>Just as in the general accounts, you will find accounting entries in the different analytic accounts. Each analytic entry can be linked to a general account, or not, as you wish. Conversely, an entry in a general account can be linked to one, several, or no corresponding analytic accounts.</p>\r\n<p>You will discover many advantages of this independent representation below. For the more impatient, here are some of those advantages:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>you can manage many different analytic operations,</li>\r\n<li>you can modify an analytic plan on the fly, during the course of an activity, because of its independence,</li>\r\n<li>you can avoid an explosion in the number of general accounts,</li>\r\n<li>even those companies that do not use Odoo\'s general accounts can use the analytic accounts for management.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Unlike general accounts, analytic accounts in Odoo are not so much an accounting tool for Accounts as a management tool for everyone in the company. (That is why they are also called management accounts.)</p>\r\n<p>The main users of analytic accounts should be the directors, general managers and project managers.</p>\r\n<p>Analytic accounts make up a powerful tool that can be used in different ways. The trick is to create your own analytic structure for a chart of accounts that closely matches your company\'s needs.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"chartofaccount\">To Each Enterprise its own Analytic Chart of Accounts</a></h2>\r\n<p>To illustrate analytic accounts clearly, you will follow three use cases, each in one of three different types of company:</p>\r\n<blockquote><ol>\r\n<li>Industrial Manufacturing Enterprise.</li>\r\n<li>Law Firm.</li>\r\n<li>IT Services Company.</li>\r\n</ol></blockquote>\r\n<h3>Case 1: Industrial Manufacturing Enterprise</h3>\r\n<p>In industry, you will often find analytic charts of accounts structured into the departments and products that the company itself is built on.</p>\r\n<p>So the objective is to examine the costs, sales and margins by department and by product. The first level of the structure comprises the different departments, and the lower levels represent the product ranges that the company makes and sells.</p>\r\n<p>Analytic Chart of Accounts for an Industrial Manufacturing Company</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Marketing Department</li>\r\n<li>Commercial Department</li>\r\n<li>Administration Department</li>\r\n<li>Production\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Product Range 1</li>\r\n<li>Sub-groups</li>\r\n<li>Product Range 2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In daily use, it is useful to mark the analytic account on each purchase invoice. The analytic account is the one to which the costs of that purchase should be allocated. When the invoice is approved, it will automatically generate the entries for both the general and the corresponding analytic accounts. So, for each entry on the general accounts, there is at least one analytic entry that allocates costs to the department that incurred them.</p>\r\n<p>Here is a possible breakdown of some general accounting entries for the example above, allocated to various analytic accounts:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Breakdown of general and analytic accounting entries

This will give you an analysis of the profitability of each product range.</p>\r\n<p>Choosing one over the other depends on how you look at your marketing effort. Is it a global cost allocated in some general way, or does each product range have responsibility for its own marketing costs?</p>\r\n<h3>Case 2: Law Firm</h3>\r\n<p>Law firms generally adopt management by case, where each case represents a current client file. All of the expenses and products are then attached to a given file.</p>\r\n<p>A principal preoccupation of law firms is the invoicing of hours worked, and the profitability by case and by employee.</p>\r\n<p>Mechanisms used for encoding the hours worked will be covered in detail in the following chapter, <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=28&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;Itemid=213\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Human Resources Management\">Key Features HR</a>. Like most system processes, hours worked are integrated into the analytic accounting. Every time an employee enters a timesheet for a number of hours, that automatically generates analytic accounts corresponding to the cost of those hours in the case concerned. The hourly charge is a function of the employee\'s salary.</p>\r\n<p>So a law firm will opt for an analytic representation which reflects the management of the time that employees work on the different client cases.</p>\r\n<p>Example Representation of an Analytic Chart of Accounts for a <code>Law Firm</code>.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Absences\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Paid Absences</li>\r\n<li>Unpaid Absences</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Internal Projects\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Administrative</li>\r\n<li>Others</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Client Cases\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Client 1\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Case 1.1</li>\r\n<li>Case 1.2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Client 2\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Case 2.1</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>All expenses and sales are then attached to a case. This gives the profitability of each case and, at a consolidated level, of each client.</p>\r\n<p>Billing for the different cases is a bit unusual. The cases do not match any entry on the general account and nor do they come from purchase or sale invoices. They are represented by the various analytic operations and do not have exact counterparts in the general accounts. They are calculated on the basis of the hourly cost per employee. These entries are automatically created on billing worksheets.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of the month when you pay salaries and benefits, you integrate them into the general accounts but not in the analytic accounts, because they have already been accounted for in billing each account. A report that relates data from the analytic and general accounts then lets you compare the totals, so you can readjust your estimates of hourly cost per employee depending on the time actually worked.</p>\r\n<p>The following table gives an example of different analytic entries that you can find for your analytic account:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Analytic entries for the account chart (Case&nbsp;2)</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><th class=\"head\">Title</th><th class=\"head\">Account</th><th class=\"head\">Amount</th><th class=\"head\">&nbsp;</th><th class=\"head\">General Account</th><th class=\"head\">Debit</th><th class=\"head\">Credit</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s6f7fd0e3bd554fa9aa19b671b7ba0404\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Study the file (1&nbsp;h)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s50759643352440c68430fc1666253492\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Case&nbsp;1.1</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s5db69086665c45518c07fe2cddace455\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">-15</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s0ca4b74bc4504e9d8a507fafb75e43cd\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Search for information (3&nbsp;h)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sa3c0e0c7a5634aca8c8851a30285201e\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Case&nbsp;1.1</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s8fa6d39de1a7425d96eaae2d1e404730\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">-45</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sbf3a177c96f4476d986bf5ea2692bfb8\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Consultation (4&nbsp;h)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s7b0a7e762ceb4ea68b52d80f92107554\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Case&nbsp;2.1</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s6cf1efa8c73a490398b8bfe5cf012f0b\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">-60</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s7b1bf45e5d57490f8b849dea082c9423\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Service charges</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sc0387cada4d04507b4791863f90479a0\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Case&nbsp;1.1</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s3e4899dfab874a2bb5890656b7288b96\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">280</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sa453b5097baf4a0a8b24aa262ef6acb2\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">705 – Billing services</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s14dfefb3d29c4104994a859791b68ead\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">280</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sdd419e61206d42539ed990e877a231e5\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Stationery purchase</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s2d8846df792946db80771e3f685c0216\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Administrative</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s58ca34cc33c447318c8d9cb5160adf2f\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">-42</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sce4b2eebffcb492191943cbdec614dfb\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">601 – Furniture purchase</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sd427071cf44f42bb8ec965b0fd4a5f2b\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">42</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sd878b14750d2440281f695a75ddddbaa\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Fuel Cost -Client trip</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sc2b32766f47a457bb921c3c18b17ba7f\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Case&nbsp;1.1</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"seb72bd9e711049f99ced3d940544e3db\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">-35</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s2728def3b9bf45f0b67cd8eefb608bcb\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">613 – Transports</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s238a3b4434d04c3781b474e44594d016\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">35</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sba21c8bcb45845fca3d5c6e2de7f1061\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Staff salaries</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s4001142f72c54e8f806a8331a30f9c6f\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">6201 – Salaries</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s4ef5c67dde2d43578f66ab2821b1b8a3\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">3&nbsp;000</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>You will see that it allows you to make a detailed study of the profitability of different transactions. In this example, the cost of Case 1.1 is 95.00 (the sum of the analytic costs of studying the files, searching for information and service charges), but has been invoiced for 280.00, which gives you a gross profit of 185.00.</p>\r\n<p>But an interest in analytical accounts is not limited to a simple analysis of the profitability of different cases.</p>\r\n<p>This same data can be used for automatic recharging of the services to the client at the end of the month. To invoice clients, just take the analytic costs in that month and apply a selling price factor to generate the invoice. Invoicing mechanisms for this are explained in greater detail in Deliver Quality Services. If the client requires details of the services used on the case, you can then print the service entries in the analytic account for this case.</p>\r\n<p>Most software that manages billing enables you to recharge for hours worked. In Odoo, these services are automatically represented by analytic costs. But many other Odoo documents can also generate analytic costs, such as credit notes and purchases of goods.</p>\r\n<p>So when you invoice the client at the end of the month, it is possible for you to include all the analytic costs, not just the hours worked. So, for example, you can easily recharge the whole cost of your journeys to the client.</p>\r\n<h3>Case 3: IT Services Company</h3>\r\n<p>Most IT service companies face the following problems:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>project planning,</li>\r\n<li>invoicing, profitability and financial follow-up of projects,</li>\r\n<li>managing support contracts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To deal with these problems, you would use an analytic chart of accounts structured by project and by contract. A representation of that is given in the following example:</p>\r\n<p>Example Analytic Representation of a Chart of Accounts for an <code>IT Services Company</code>.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Internal Projects\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Administrative and Commercial</li>\r\n<li>Research and Development</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Client Projects\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Client 1\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Project 1.1</li>\r\n<li>Project 1.2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Client 2\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Project 2.1</li>\r\n<li>Project 2.2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Support Contracts – 20h\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Customer X</li>\r\n<li>Customer Y</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The management of services, expenditures and sales is similar to that presented above for lawyers. Invoicing and the study of profitability are also similar.</p>\r\n<p>But now look at support contracts. These contracts are usually limited to a prepaid number of hours. Each service posted in the analytic accounts shows the remaining available hours of support. For the management of support contracts, you would use the quantities and not the amounts in the analytic entries.</p>\r\n<p>In Odoo, each analytic line lists the number of units sold or used, as well as what you would usually find there – the amount in currency units (USD or GBP, or whatever other choice you make). So you can sum the quantities sold and used on each analytic account to determine whether any hours of the support contract remain.</p>\r\n<p>To differentiate services from other costs in the analytic account, you use the concept of the analytic journal. Analytic entries are then allocated into the different journals:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>service journal,</li>\r\n<li>expense journal,</li>\r\n<li>sales journal,</li>\r\n<li>purchase journal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>So to obtain the detailed breakdown of a support contract, you only have to look at the service journal for the analytic account corresponding to the contract in question.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the analytic account can be used to forecast future needs. For example, monthly planning of staff on different projects can be seen as an analytic budget limited to the service journal. Accounting entries are expressed in quantities (such as number of hours, and numbers of products), and in amounts in units of currency (USD or GBP perhaps).</p>\r\n<p>So you can set up planning on just the basis of quantities. Analyzing the analytic budget enables you to compare the budget (that is, your plan) to the services actually carried out by month end.</p>\r\n<p>Problems of cash management are amongst the main difficulties encountered by small growing businesses. It is really difficult to predict the amount of cash that will be available when a company is young and rapidly growing.</p>\r\n<p>If the company adopts management by case, then staff planning can be represented on the analytic accounts report, as you have seen.</p>\r\n<p>But since you know your selling price for each of the different projects, you can see that it is easy to use the plan in the analytic accounts to more precisely forecast the amounts that you will invoice in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>', '1', '30', '2015-08-10 23:38:18', '836', '', '2015-08-10 23:38:25', '836', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-08-10 23:38:18', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}', '1', '2', '', 'Odoo enables you to perform analysis of purchases by period (year, month), by state (quotations, orders), supplier, product, category, warehouse and so on.', '1', '3682', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0', 'en-GB', ''), ('69', '225', 'Understanding Double-Entry Stock Management', 'understanding-double-entry-stock-management', '<p>Just as in accounting, the Odoo system manages counterparts to each of its main operations such as receipts from suppliers, deliveries to customers, profit and loss from inventory, and consumption of raw materials.

In accounting you would say that the sum of the debits is equal to the sum of the credits.</p>\r\n<p>Partner locations (customers and suppliers) are not located under your company in the hierarchical structure, so their contents are not considered as part of your own stock. So if you just look at the physical locations inside your own company, those two bicycles are no longer in your company. Although they are no longer in your own physical stock, it is still very useful to see them in your customer\'s stock, because that will help when you carry out detailed stock management analysis.</p>\r\n<p>To manage Consignment Stock, you need to define the location for the consignment customer or supplier as part of your own stock and not as a partner location.</p>\r\n<p>In managing stock, a gap between the data in the software and real quantities in stock is difficult to avoid. Double-entry stock management gives twice as many opportunities to find an error. If you forget two items of stock, this error will automatically be reflected in the counterpart\'s location.</p>\r\n<p>You can make a comparison with accounting, where you will easily find an error because you can look for an anomaly in an account or in the counterparts: if there is not enough in a bank account then that is probably because someone has forgotten to enter a customer\'s invoice payment. You always know that the sum of debits must equal the sum of the credits in both accounting and Odoo\'s stock management.</p>\r\n<p>In accounting, all documents lead to accounting entries that form the basis of management accounting. If you create invoices or enter statements of account, for example, the results of the operations are accounting entries on accounts. And it is the same for stock management in Odoo. All stock operations are carried out as simple stock moves. Whether you pack items, or manufacture them, or carry out a stock inventory operation, stock moves are carried out every time.</p>\r\n<p>You have seen a fairly simple example of goods receipt and product delivery, but some operations are less obvious – a stock inventory operation, for example. An inventory operation is carried out when you compare the stock shown in software with real stock numbers counted in the stores.</p>\r\n<p>In Odoo, with its double-entry stock management, you would use stock moves for this inventory operation. That helps you manage your stock traceability. Suppose there are 26 bicycles in real stock, but Odoo shows 28 in the system. You then have to reduce the number in Odoo to 26. This reduction of 2 units is considered as a loss or destruction of products and the correction is carried out as in the following operation:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Inventory Operation to Adjust Stock</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><th class=\"head\">Location</th><th class=\"head\">Products</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s0fac49811e104d14849033c5bc1e1043\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Physical Locations &gt; OpenERP S.A. &gt; Stock</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"scc97fa385c8d42f0baf14b7aad8d729c\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">-2 bicycles</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sb22b650a7035460082085ba842ec1dde\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Virtual Locations &gt; Inventory Loss</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s4649216ed2d84a4092a096fd4f39f0e1\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">+2 bicycles</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The product stock under consideration then becomes:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Real and Counterpart Stocks when Operations are Completed</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><th class=\"head\">Location</th><th class=\"head\">Products</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s1dc710cf59be417f91a0ce948bcf6836\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Partner Locations &gt; Suppliers</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s340a7c8886b34b7e81ccf7aaeea1a781\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">-30 bicycles</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s55f8f10177d747319cbfb71fd7d43a22\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Physical Locations &gt; OpenERP S.A. &gt; Stock</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s30816860b3a64a50ba22a209fd851c41\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">+26 bicycles</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sb66e4e80b4a94067adbdd60155cbf5e2\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Partner Locations &gt; Customers &gt; European Customers</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s6131da460c56482cbc4f794cb5e39663\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">+2 bicycles</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s449a6b5149864ea78ac11ab9043c0959\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Virtual Locations &gt; Inventory Loss</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sc929c66c107c43f8818b2a28437fdda7\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">+2 bicycles</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>This example shows one of the great advantages of this approach in terms of performance analysis.

To make a bicycle you need two wheels and a frame. This means that there should be a reduction of two wheels and a frame from real stock and the addition of a bicycle there. The consumption / production is formalized by moving products out of and into physical stock. The stock operations for this are as follows:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Stock Situation Resulting from Manufacturing</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><th class=\"head\">Location</th><th class=\"head\">Products</th><th class=\"head\">Step</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s0eae76ccd1e647cba2e1078823666684\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Physical Locations &gt; OpenERP S.A. &gt; Stock</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s7cc0f27412364681a8c39ecd9566c8b7\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">-2 Wheels</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s63cc5691d13d4590835859c7fdb0b638\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Consumption of raw materials</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s6099e96628564243a9841cf04174bf60\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Virtual Locations &gt; Production</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s2a4a6d3b49384848b0ceee92343290f5\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">+2 Wheels</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s384940264b4a420a893045ab5578098c\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Consumption of raw materials</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s11cfbd3cbf6d4e9390fb79db3c7c2524\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Physical Locations &gt; OpenERP S.A. &gt; Stock</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sc7d9f5861a26490d8a91c929c2e25cac\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">-1 Frame</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s1188d3b770a647a584cd4a29d6ff8c77\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Consumption of raw materials</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s72e46d28a2294336ae3bb18d37055abc\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Virtual Locations &gt; Production</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s56b90a1d12f84419ad458fbca7c62409\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">+1 Frame</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sc9acc096d40a47378ffadcb026585783\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Consumption of raw materials</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s6e8d985824c9442b8f34f57a8df8e80c\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Virtual Locations &gt; Production</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sef2eb2c355a8485c82fefd5aa0724079\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">-1 Bicycle</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sf0ec3c4058fc424aba5c0f12b9dc6718\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Manufacture of finished products</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s31f41e6fbf3147af9a942955595600c6\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Physical Locations &gt; OpenERP S.A. &gt; Stock</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s45fd95d4fd3b48c5bff458c10b756d92\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">+1 Bicycle</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sb3f8c83f2df94e93bc622bbe0b88fdde\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Manufacture of finished products</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>So now you have got the outcome you need from the consumption of raw materials and the manufacturing of finished products.</p>\r\n<p>You might already have noticed a useful effect of this approach: if you do a stock valuation in the <code>Virtual Locations &gt; Production location</code> you get a statement of value created by your company (as a negative amount).

When you buy products from a supplier, you should take account of the Warehouse you use for this purchase. This also enables the end user to not have to choose from a list of locations, but simply a real warehouse. Use the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Configuration &gt; Warehouses</code>, then click <code>Create</code> to configure a new warehouse.</p>\r\n', '\r\n<p>A warehouse is defined by a link between three locations:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <code>Location Stock</code> field shows the place of products available for delivery to a customer directly from this warehouse. Availability is given by all the products in that location and any child locations.</li>\r\n<li>The <code>Location Input</code> field shows where ordered products are received from a supplier in that warehouse. It can be the same as the stock location if, for example, you want to do a quality control operation on your incoming raw materials.</li>\r\n<li>The <code>Location Output</code> field (called Output in the demonstration database) is designed as a buffer zone in which you store all the items that have been picked, but not yet delivered to a customer. You are strongly advised not to put this location within the stock hierarchy but instead at a higher level or at the same level.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_warehouse_copy.png\" alt=\"stock warehouse copy\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Warehouse Parameters</code></em></p>\r\n<p>You can also set an address for the warehouse. This address should ideally be an address of your company. Once the warehouse has been defined, it can be used in:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Reordering rules,</li>\r\n<li>Supplier orders,</li>\r\n<li>Customer orders (using the definition of a point of sale, which is linked to a warehouse).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Automatic Procurement</h3>\r\n<p>Several methods of automatically procuring products can be carried out by Odoo:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the workflow used by products that have the procurement method <code>Make to Order</code>,</li>\r\n<li>using Reordering rules for <code>Make to Stock</code> products,</li>\r\n<li>using the master production schedule for <code>Make to Stock</code> products.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The last two methods are described below.</p>\r\n<h3>Reordering Rules</h3>\r\n<p>To automatically make stock replenishment proposals, you can use Reordering rules. Go to the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Configuration &gt; Reordering Rules</code>.</p>\r\n<p>The rule is the following: if the virtual stock for the given location is lower than the minimum stock indicated in the rule, the system will automatically propose a procurement to increase the level of virtual stock to the maximum level given in the rule.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_min_rule.png\" alt=\"stock min rule\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>List of Reordering Rules</code></em></p>\r\n<p>You may find draft production or procurement orders to be created although they should not exist. That can happen if the system is badly configured (for example, if you have forgotten to set the supplier on a product).</p>\r\n<p>To check this, look at the list of procurements in the exception state in the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Schedulers &gt; Procurement</code>.</p>\r\n<p>We underline that the rule is based on virtual quantities and not just on real quantities. It takes into account the calculation of orders and receipts to come.</p>\r\n<p>Take the following example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Products in stock: 15</li>\r\n<li>Products ordered but not delivered: 5</li>\r\n<li>Products in manufacturing: 2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The rules defined are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Minimum stock: 13</li>\r\n<li>Maximum stock: 25.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once the rules have been properly configured, the purchasing manager only needs to look at the list of orders for confirmation with the supplier using the menu <code>Purchases &gt; Purchase &gt; Quotations</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Note that the procurement does not require that you buy from a supplier. If the product has a Routes <code>Manufacture</code>, the scheduler will generate a Manufacturing order instead of a supplier order.</p>\r\n<p>You can also set multiple quantities in the reordering rules. If you set a multiple quantity of 3 the system will propose procurement of 15 pieces, and not the 13 it really needs. In this case, it automatically rounds the quantity upwards.</p>\r\n<p>Pay attention to the fact that the maximum quantity is not the maximum you will have in stock. If we take the following situation: a company has 10 pieces of product with minimum stock rules defined for this product by Min quantity = 10, Max quantity = 30 and Qty multiple = 12. If an order of 2 pieces comes, a purchase of 24 pieces order will be executed. The first 12 pieces will be ordered to reach the minimum quantity and the other 12 to reach the maximum quantity. At the end, the stock of this product will be equal to 32 pieces.</p>\r\n<p>In a reordering rule, when you indicate a warehouse, it suggests a stock location by default in that warehouse. You can change that default location when the scheduler completes.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"location\">Location</a></h2>\r\n<p>A location is one component of the warehouses that is used to managed all types of storage places, such as at the customer\'s and production counterparts.</p>\r\n<p>There are different types of locations that allow you to structure your warehouses according to your needs. Locations are structured hierarchically to account for the subdivision of a warehouse into sections, aisles, and/or cupboards. The hierarchical view also enables you to structure virtual locations such as production counterparts. That gives you a finer level of analysis. Go to the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Configuration &gt; Locations</code>, then click <code>Create</code> to define new locations.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_location_form.png\" alt=\"stock location form\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Defining a new Stock Location</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Here are the different available types of locations:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Supplier Location</code>: virtual location representing the source location for products received from suppliers,</li>\r\n<li><code>View</code>: shows that the location is only an organizational node for the hierarchical structure, and cannot be involved in stock moves itself. The view type is not made into a leaf node in a structure – it usually has children.</li>\r\n<li><code>Internal Location</code>: physical location inside your own stock,</li>\r\n<li><code>Customer Location</code>: virtual location representing the destination for products sent to customers,</li>\r\n<li><code>Inventory</code>: virtual location serving as the counterpart for inventory operations used to correct stock levels (physical inventories),</li>\r\n<li><code>Procurement</code>: virtual location serving as temporary counterpart for procurement operations when you do not yet know the source (supplier or production). Products in this location should be zero after the scheduler run completes,</li>\r\n<li><code>Production</code>: virtual counterpart location for production operations; consuming raw material and sending finished products,</li>\r\n<li><code>Transit Location for Inter-Companies Transfers</code>: used as an intermediate location in a multi-company environment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can have several locations of the same type. In that case, your product, supplier and warehouse configurations determine the location that is to be used for any given operation.</p>\r\n<h3>Location Addresses</h3>\r\n<p>Each location can have a specific address that enables you to create a location for a customer or a supplier, for example. You can then give it the address of that customer or supplier. Go to the partner form to tell Odoo it should use this location rather than the default location given to partner deliveries.</p>\r\n<p>You will see in the chapter Manufacturing that it is possible to assign a location to a manufacturing workcenter. If this location is at a supplier’s, you must give it an address so that Odoo can prepare a delivery order for the supplier and a receive operation for the manufactured goods. Creating a location specifically for a partner is also a simple solution for handling consigned stocks in Odoo.</p>\r\n<p>Consigned stock is stock that is owned by you (valued in your accounts), but is physically stocked by your supplier. Or, conversely, it could be stock owned by your customer (not valued by you), but stocked in your company. Make sure that you create consignment locations as part of your internal stock.</p>\r\n<p>To enable you to easily consolidate at a higher level, the location definition is hierarchical. This structure is given by the field Parent Location. That also enables you to manage complex cases of product localization.</p>\r\n<p>For example, you could imagine the following scenario: One Company with Two Warehouses</p>\r\n<p>A company has a warehouse in Paris and in Bordeaux. For some orders, you have to deliver the products from Paris, and for others from Bordeaux. But you should also specify a fictitious warehouse that Odoo uses to calculate whether it should deliver products from Paris or from Bordeaux. To do this in Odoo, you would create a third warehouse ‘France’ which consolidates the warehouses in Paris and Bordeaux. You create the following physical locations:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Company\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Output\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Warehouses France\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Warehouse Paris</li>\r\n<li>Warehouse Bordeaux</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Odoo will then deliver the goods from the warehouse that has the ordered product in stock. When products are available in several warehouses, Odoo will select the nearest warehouse. To formalize the notion of distance between warehouses you should use the geographic co-ordinates (X, Y, Z) of the different stores to enable Odoo to search for the nearest goods. The same co-ordinates could also be used to structure the shelves, aisles and interior rooms in a warehouse.</p>\r\n<h3>Linked Locations</h3>\r\n<p>Locations in Odoo can be linked between each other to define paths followed by products. So you can define rules such as: all products that enter the warehouse should automatically be sent to quality control. The warehouse and quality control are represented by two different locations.</p>\r\n<p>Then when a product arrives in a location, Odoo can automatically suggest that you send the product to another linked location. Three link modes are available:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Manual Operation,</li>\r\n<li>Automatic Move,</li>\r\n<li>Automatic No Step Added.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The <code>Manual Operation</code> mode will create an internal move order to the linked location once products arrive in the source locations. This order will wait for a confirmation of the move by a user. This enables you to have a list of moves to do, proposed by the system and confirmed by the storesperson.</p>\r\n<p>The <code>Automatic Move</code> mode will do the same, but will not wait for a confirmation from the user. Products will automatically be sent to the linked location without any intervening manual operation to do. This corresponds to the case where, for simplicity, you delete a step in the process so the end user can set off the process automatically.</p>\r\n<p>The <code>Automatic No Step Added</code> mode will not include the additional stock move, but will change the destination move transparently to assign the linked location. You could then assign a destination location to which you send all the products that arrive in your warehouse. The storesperson will modify the goods receipt note.</p>\r\n<p>The module stock_location lets you generate paths to follow, not just at the level of locations, but also at the level of products. It then enables you to manage default locations for a given product or to refer to the products as a function of operations such as quality control, supplier receipt, and after-sales service.</p>\r\n<p>A more detailed explanation of this module, with examples, is given at the end of this chapter.</p>\r\n<p>If there is linking to do, the Chained Location Type field allows you to determine the destination location. If the field is set to ‘Customer’, the location is given by the properties of the partner form. If the field is set to fixed, the destination location is given by the field Chained Location If Fixed.</p>\r\n<p>Some operations take a certain time between order and execution. To account for this lead time, you can set a value in days in the field Chaining Lead Time. Then the extra move (automatic or not) will be carried out several days after the original move. If you use the mode Automatic No Step Added, the lead time is inserted directly into the initial order. In this way, you can add security lead times at certain control points in the warehouse.</p>\r\n<p>The module <code>stock_location</code> lets you generate paths to follow, not just at the level of locations, but also at the level of products. It then enables you to manage default locations for a given product or to refer to the products as a function of operations such as quality control, supplier receipt, and after-sales service.</p>\r\n<p>A more detailed explanation of this module, with examples, is given at the end of this chapter.</p>\r\n<p>If there is linking to do, the Chained Location Type field allows you to determine the destination location.

If you use the mode <code>Automatic No Step Added</code>, the lead time is inserted directly into the initial order. In this way, you can add security lead times at certain control points in the warehouse.</p>\r\n<h3>Structuring Locations</h3>\r\n<p>In the next part, you will see that by linking locations you can manage a whole series of complex cases for efficient production management:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Handling multiple operations for a customer order,</li>\r\n<li>Tracking import and export by sea transport,</li>\r\n<li>Managing a production chain in detail,</li>\r\n<li>Managing rented products,</li>\r\n<li>Managing consigned products.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To show these concepts, different cases of structuring and configuring these locations are given below. Many other configurations are possible according to company needs.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Handling customer orders</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Customer orders are usually handled in one of two ways:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>item note (or preparation order), confirmed when the item is ready to send,</li>\r\n<li>delivery order (or freight note), confirmed when the transporter has delivered the item to a customer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>You use the following stock move in Odoo to simulate these operations:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Packing Note: Stock &gt; Output,</li>\r\n<li>Delivery Order: Output &gt; Customer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The first operation is automatically generated by the customer order. The second one is generated by the stock management, showing that the Output location is linked to the Customer location. The two operations will be displayed in Waiting status. If the Output location is not situated beneath the stock location, you then have to move the item from stock to the place where the item is prepared.</p>\r\n<p>Some companies do not want to work in two steps, because it just seems like extra work to have to confirm a delivery note in the system. You can then set the link mode to ‘Automatic’ to make Odoo automatically confirm the second step. It is then assumed all the items have automatically been delivered to the customer.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Linked production</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The <code>stock_location</code> module enables you to manage the linkages by product in addition to doing that by location. You can then create a location structure that represents your production chain by product.</p>\r\n<p>The location structure may look like this:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Stock\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Level 1</li>\r\n<li>Level 2\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Link 1\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Operation 1</li>\r\n<li>Operation 2</li>\r\n<li>Operation 3</li>\r\n<li>Operation 4</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can then set the locations a product or a routing must go through in the relevant form. All products that enter the production chain will automatically follow the predetermined path. You can see the location structure using <code>Warehouse &gt; Inventory Control &gt; Location Structure</code>.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"stock\">Stock</a></h2>\r\n<p>In the Product form, the <code>Stock by Location</code> action will give you the stock levels of the various products in any selected location. If you have not selected any location, Odoo calculates stocks for all of the physical locations. When you are in the <code>Stock by Location</code> view, click the <code>Print</code> button to print the <code>Location Content</code> or the <code>Location Inventory Overview</code> reports.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on whether you look at the product from a customer order, or from the menu of a product form, you can get different values for stock availability. If you use the Product menu, you get the stock in all of the physical stock locations. Looking at the product from the order you will only see the report of the warehouse selected in the order.</p>\r\n<p>In this respect, two important fields in the product form are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Real Stock</code>: Quantity physically present in your warehouse,</li>\r\n<li><code>Virtual Stock</code>: Calculated as follows: real stock – outgoing + incoming.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><code>Virtual</code> stock is very useful because it shows what the salespeople can sell. If the virtual stock is higher than the real stock, this means products will be coming in. If virtual stock is smaller than real stock, certain products are reserved for other sales orders or work orders.</p>\r\n<p>To get more details about future stock, you can find <code>Stock Level Forecast</code> option in the <code>Print</code> button at the top center of the product form. It will saw the report <code>Forecast Stock Levels</code> as illustrated below. Odoo shows a graph of the changes in stock in the days to come, varying as a function of purchase orders, confirmed production and sales orders.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_forecast_report.png\" alt=\"stock forecast report\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Printout of forecast stock levels</code></em></p>\r\n<p>By default, in Product list view, the columns <code>Real Stock</code> and <code>Virtual Stock</code> show the stock figures for all stock locations where a product is stored. Use the <code>Extended Filters</code> to enter a specific stock location, if you want to only see the stock in a specific location.</p>\r\n<h3>Lead Times and Locations</h3>\r\n<p>The tab <code>Procurement</code> in the Product form contains information about Manufacturing lead time:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Manufacturing Lead Time</code>: lead time, in days, between a production order and the end of production of the finished product,</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The tab <code>Sale</code> in the Product form contains information about Warranty and Customer Lead Time:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Warranty</code>: length of time in months for the warranty of the delivered products.</li>\r\n<li><code>Customer Lead Time</code>: lead time promised to the customer, expressed in number of days between the order and the delivery to the customer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The warranty period is used in the Repairs management and after-sales service.</p>\r\n<p>The tab <code>Inventory</code> in the Product form contains information about Locations:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Storage Localisation</code>: for information only; they do not have any impact on the management of stock.</li>\r\n<li><code>Counter-Part Locations Properties</code>: automatically proposed by the system, but the different values can be modified. You will find counterpart locations for:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Procurement</code>: This stock location will be used, instead of the default one, as the source location for stock moves generated by procurements,</li>\r\n<li><code>Production</code>: This stock location will be used, instead of the default one, as the source location for stock moves generated by manufacturing orders ,</li>\r\n<li><code>Inventory</code>:This stock location will be used, instead of the default one, as the source location for stock moves generated when you do an inventory.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A procurement location is a temporary location for stock moves that have not yet been finalized by the scheduler. When the system does not yet know if procurement is to be done by a purchase or production, Odoo uses the counterpart location Procurement. In this location, you will find everything that has not yet been planned by the system. The quantities of product in this location cancel each other out.</p>\r\n<h3>Initial Inventory</h3>\r\n<p>Once a product has been defined, use an initial inventory operation to put current quantities into the system by location for the products in stock. Go to the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Inventory Control &gt; Inventory Adjustments</code> to do your initial inventory.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_inventory_new.png\" alt=\"stock inventory new\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Defining a New Inventory Operation</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Give a name (for example Initial Inventory or Lost Product XYZ ) and a date (proposed by default) for each inventory operation.</p>\r\n<p>You have three ways of doing an inventory.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Click the Fill Inventory button at the top right side of the form view and select the location concerned. You can choose to include child locations and set the inventory to zero (especially useful to ensure the count is done correctly).</li>\r\n<li>You can update the inventory from the Product form. Go to the Inventory tab, Stock and Expected Variations section, and click on the Update. On confirmation, Odoo will create a Physical Inventory.</li>\r\n<li>You can manually add inventory lines. You can then enter data about the quantities available for each product by location. Start by entering the location, for example Stock , and then select the product. Odoo automatically completes the quantity available for that product in the location shown. You can then change that value to correct the value in stock.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Enter data for a single line in your inventory:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Location</code>: Stock,</li>\r\n<li><code>Product</code>: PC1 Basic PC,</li>\r\n<li><code>Quantity</code>: 23 Units.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When your inventory operation is finished, you can confirm it using the <code>Confirm Inventory</code> button on the form. Odoo will then automatically create the stock moves to close the gaps, as mentioned at the start of this chapter. You can verify the moves generated using the <code>Posted Inventory</code> tab of the inventory operation form.</p>\r\n<p>The correct levels of your product are now in your stock locations. A simple way of verifying this is to reopen the product form to see the quantities available in stock.</p>\r\n<p>You are usually legally required to do a stock check of all your products at least once a year. As well as doing a complete annual stock check, Odoo also supports the method of periodical inventory.</p>\r\n<p>That means you can check the stock levels of a proportion of your products every so often. This system is accepted in France as long as you can guarantee that all of your products have been counted at least once per year. To see the last inventory count per product, use the report <code>Reporting &gt; Warehouse &gt; Last Inventories &amp; Moves</code>.</p>\r\n<p>You can do this the same way for all products and all locations, so you only carry out small inventory operations through the year, rather than a single large stock check at one point in the year (which usually turns out to be at an inconvenient time).&nbsp;</p>', '1', '31', '2015-08-11 00:37:50', '836', '', '2015-08-17 02:31:29', '836', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-08-11 00:37:50', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}', '2', '2', '', 'Warehouses are designed for physical locations from which you can deliver to the customer, and to which you receive raw materials.

To receive the products through this method, you have to go to <code>Incoming Shipments</code> section (<code>Warehouse &gt; Operations &gt; All Operations &gt; YourCompany: Receipts</code>), click <code>Create</code> and then you enter the information about the receipt.</p>\r\n', '\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_getting.png\" alt=\"stock getting\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Manual Data Entry for Product Receipt</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The second method is to receive products from a generated incoming shipment. To achieve the reception using this method, you have to go to <code>Incoming Shipments</code> section. You will find the list of waiting incoming shipments.</p>\r\n<p>The third method is to receive products by waiting products without looking at the shipment document.You can validate the reception by products in <code>Warehouse &gt; Operations &gt; All Operations &gt; YourCompany: Receipt</code>. With this method, you will be able to receive one product, regardless of the document which is attached to this product.</p>\r\n<h3>Receipt of a Supplier Order by Purchase Order</h3>\r\n<p>If you use <code>Purchase Orders</code> in Odoo, product receipts are automatically generated by the system when the purchase order is confirmed. You do not have to enter any date, just confirm that the quantities ordered match the quantities received.</p>\r\n<p><code>Incoming Shipments</code> forms are automatically prepared by Odoo from the purchase management process. You will find a list of all the awaited receipts in the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Operations &gt; All Operations &gt; YourCompany: Receipt</code>. Use the order number or the supplier name to find the right goods receipt form for confirmation of a goods-in. This approach enables you to control quantities received by referring to the quantities ordered.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_picking_in_tree.png\" alt=\"stock picking in tree\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Incoming Shipments from Purchase management</code></em></p>\r\n<p>You can also do goods-in data entry manually if there is no order, in Incoming Shipments menu by clicking the Create button.</p>\r\n<p>A new goods-in data entry form opens. Enter the supplier in the Supplier field and type the reference number from your supplier in the field Source Document.</p>\r\n<p>Now in Product tab, click on Add an item and select Product &amp; quantity. In that form the source location is already completed by default because of your supplier selection. You should then give the destination location where you will place the products. For example, enter Stock. At this stage, you can set a Serial number for traceability (this function will be described later in this chapter, so leave this field empty for the moment).</p>\r\n<p>Once the form has been completed, you can click on save button &amp; close that wizard.</p>\r\n<p>Now in Additional info tab, You can select the Delivery method either partial or All at once. Confirm this incoming shipment.</p>\r\n<p>Next go to Incoming Products, in list view you will find your created incoming shipment, open that order, you can find buttons on that form, Process Partially and Process Entirely. (Process Partially button available only if you have select delivery method partially in Additional info tab of Incoming shipment)</p>\r\n<p>If you click , the wizard open and seems like following figure, for example 18 quantity of Datacard product,</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/product_to_process.png\" alt=\"product to process\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Confirm partial reception</code></em></p>\r\n<p>After doing of partial process, another object will be generated with a back order reference equal to the <code>Reference</code> number of the incoming shipment already confirmed. Now you can find in list view of Incoming product seems like following figure.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/partial_shipment.png\" alt=\"partial shipment\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Process a Partial Incoming Shipment</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Once the rest of the order has arrived and has been processed, both orders will be merged.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_picking_in_form.png\" alt=\"stock picking in form\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Form for Entering Goods received from a Supplier Order</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The products then arrive in stock and should reflect the quantities shown on the product form.</p>\r\n<p>In the Incoming Shipments form, the field <code>Invoice Control</code> lets you influence the way you send invoices to suppliers. If this is set to <code>To be invoiced</code>, a supplier invoice will now be generated automatically in the draft state, based on the goods received. Your accountant then has to confirm this pre-invoicing once the supplier\'s invoice is received. This enables you to verify that the invoiced quantities correspond to the quantities received.</p>\r\n<p>In order to print the picking Slip of an incoming shipment, select the incoming shipment of which you need the details and click <code>Receipt Slip</code> from the <code>Print</code> button at the top center of the screen.</p>\r\n<p>This Delivery Slip is available in the <code>Internal Moves</code> and <code>Delivery Orders</code> sections.</p>\r\n<p>In case you received damaged or wrong products, you can return them to the supplier. In the Incoming shipment form, click the <code>Return Products</code> button. A window will open that lets you choose the invoicing process to follow. Once you click <code>Process</code>, a stock move is generated with the same reference number and return to specify that this is a return move.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/return_product_stock_move.png\" alt=\"return product stock move\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Stock Move for Returned Products</code></em></p>\r\n<h3>Receipt of a Supplier Order by Product</h3>\r\n<p>The approach shown above is very useful if goods receipts correspond to the original orders. If your suppliers deliver items that do not necessarily coincide with the orders, however, it is easier to work by products received rather than by orders.</p>\r\n<p>From this version on, you can also handle receptions by product, even from List view. Go to <code>Warehouse &gt; Operations &gt; All Operations &gt; YourCompany: Receipt</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Filters allow you to easily select receipts to be done, and so on. One way to quickly receive products is to Group by Product,`Picking`,etc and select To Do.</p>\r\n<p>This is very useful functionality when your supplier sends the goods for several purchase orders at a time. You can now just receive the products, regardless of the purchase order they come from, simply by clicking the green arrow at the right side of the screen.</p>\r\n<p>The List view offers great flexibility and allows you to rapidly incoming products by keeping full functionality! Of course, you can handle both partial and complete receptions, and you can add information about the <code>Serial Numbers</code> and packs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/receive_products.png\" alt=\"receive products\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Incoming Products Group By Product</code></em></p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"internal\">Internal Stock Moves</a></h2>\r\n<p>You should install the <code>stock_location</code> module (from the list of modules) if routing products to customers, from suppliers or in your warehouse is determined by the identity of the product itself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/product_location.png\" alt=\"product location\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Managing the Paths from one Location to Another in a Product Form (In Inventory tab)</code></em></p>\r\n<p>This will let you configure logistics rules individually for each product. For example, when a specific product arrives in stores, it can automatically be sent to quality control. In this case, it has to be configured as a Push Flow with rules in the Product form. The fields that make up those rules are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Source Location</code>: the rule only applies if a product comes from this location,</li>\r\n<li><code>Destination Location</code>: the rule only applies if a product ends up in this location,</li>\r\n<li><code>Automatic Move</code>: Automatic Move, Manual Operation, Automatic No Step Added,</li>\r\n<li><code>Delay (days)</code>:,</li>\r\n<li><code>Operation</code>: a free text field which will be included in the automatic stock move proposed by Odoo.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are two main logistic flows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Push Flow</li>\r\n<li>Pull Flow</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><code>Push flows</code> are useful when the arrival of certain products in a given location should always be followed by a corresponding move to another location, optionally after a certain delay. The original Warehouse application already supports such Push flow specifications on the Locations themselves, but these cannot be refined per product. <code>Pull flows</code> are a bit different from Push flows, in the sense that they are not related to the processing of product moves, but rather to the processing of procurement orders. What is being pulled is a need, not directly products. You will now see some examples of using these locations and logistics by product through Pushed Flows for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A rentable product,</li>\r\n<li>A product bought in China, following its freight by ship from port to port,</li>\r\n<li>A product that you want to send to quality control before putting it in stocks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We will develop the third scenario: the quality control.</p>\r\n<p>You can configure the system to put a given product in the <code>Quality Control</code> bay automatically when it arrives in your company. To do that, you just configure a rule for the product to be placed in the <code>Quality Control</code> location rather than the <code>Input</code> location when the product is received from the supplier.</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Rule to Move Products manually from Input to Quality Control</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><th class=\"head\">Field</th><th class=\"head\">Value</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"saca7c4b93ec346fdb90b31fbf9c3d5f4\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Source location</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s61e8b738bafe42dca0e3116ac81de0ee\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Stock</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s5c1d9048ed7646caa888306b573d68ca\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Destination location</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s1e3ed621890442d9ac386e0c560f5239\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Quality Control</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sfe36a8343b9144238f57707ff470bfb4\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Automatic Move</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s6f3389b132ba4525b16a7544e194da75\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Manual Operation</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s1ab1814768564c8fbae37090fd51c465\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Shipping Type</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s4096dc45ed4e4680821bfa680dcca62f\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Getting Goods</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s72ee6225f3d14da9bfe5869ff44b1d4c\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Delay (days)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"se810811bd97142428bebffadd5366b4e\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">0</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s8c698b928f8648309ecaea4fb58d0c55\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Operation</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sbd4b19c598244730b48886b558fc58a6\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Quality Control</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Once this product has been received, Odoo will automatically manage the request for an internal movement to send it to the Quality Control location.

This time, use the automated product delivery processes based on customer orders. Install the <code>sale</code> module , so that you can proceed further in this section of the chapter.</p>\r\n<p>Now create a new sales order from the menu <code>Sales &gt; Sales &gt; Sales Orders</code>. Enter the following data in this order:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Shop</code>: Your Company</li>\r\n<li><code>Customer</code>: Agrolait</li>\r\n<li><code>Order lines</code>:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Product</code>: [DC] Data Card,</li>\r\n<li><code>Quantity (UoM)</code>: 3,</li>\r\n<li><code>Product UoM</code>: Unit(s),</li>\r\n<li><code>Procurement Method</code>: from stock.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You have already seen that Odoo shows the available product stock in list view. The real stock is equal to the virtual stock because you have nothing to deliver to customers and you are not waiting for any of these products to be received into stock. The salesperson then has all the information needed to take orders efficiently.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_sale_form.png\" alt=\"stock sale form\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Entering an Order for Three Data Card</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Then confirm the quotation to convert it to an order.

This manages the reservation of products and places orders based on the dates promised to customers, and the various internal lead times and priorities. Three products will be reserved in the order that you created, so they cannot be sold to another customer.</p>\r\n<p>Install the module <code>mrp_jit</code> to schedule each order in real time after it has been confirmed. This means that you do not have to start the scheduler or wait for its periodical start time.</p>\r\n<p>Now have a look at the list of deliveries waiting to be carried out using the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Operations &gt; All Operations &gt; YourCompany: Delivery Orders</code>. You find a line there for your order representing the items to be sent.

If you enter a value less than the forecasted one, Odoo automatically generates a partial delivery note and a new order for the remaining items. For this exercise, just confirm all the products.</p>\r\n<p>However, if you want to look at a partial shipping, an example will be developed at the end of this section.</p>\r\n<p>If you return to the list of current orders, you will see that your order has now been marked as <code>Done</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_sale_tree.png\" alt=\"stock sale tree\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>List of Orders with their State</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Stock Management is very flexible to be more effective. For example, if you forget to enter products at goods-in, this will not prevent you from sending them to customers. In Odoo, you can force all operations manually using the button <code>Force Availability</code>. In this case, your stocks risk to become negative. You should monitor all stocks for negative levels and carry out an inventory correction when that happens.</p>\r\n<h3>Partial Shipping</h3>\r\n<p>Should you have to process a partial delivery, you can go to <code>Warehouse &gt; Operations &gt; All Operations &gt; YourCompany: Delivery Orders</code>, then select the order to process it.

A new window will open and will let you choose the invoicing method.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/return_picking.png\" alt=\"return picking\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Return Products from Customers</code></em></p>\r\n<p>When the product is returned, it will go back to your stock and you will see a stock move.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/return_product.png\" alt=\"return product\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Stock Move for a Returned Product</code></em></p>\r\n<h3>Just In Time</h3>\r\n<p>By default, scheduling starts automatically once a day. You should make this scheduling execute overnight to ensure that the system does not slow down under a heavy load of scheduling when you are also trying to use it interactively.</p>\r\n<p>To set the start time for the scheduler, go to the menu <code>Setting &gt; Technical &gt; Automation &gt; Scheduled Actions</code>. Select the rule called <code>Run mrp scheduler</code> and modify the date and time of the next execution.</p>\r\n<p>Some companies want to plan orders progressively as they are entered, so they do not wait until procurement orders are planned the next day. Install the module <code>mrp_jit</code> to handle this. Once the module is installed, each requirement (that could result in a <code>Production</code> or <code>Purchase Order</code>) will be planned in real time as soon as it has been confirmed.</p>\r\n<p>Then if you make a sales order with a product that is <code>Make To Order</code>, the quotation request to a supplier will immediately be generated.</p>\r\n<p>This mode does not always makes sense. Each order is processed immediately when confirmed. So if an order is to be delivered in three months, the scheduler will reserve goods in stock for each order once it has been confirmed. It would have been more sensible to leave these products available for other orders.</p>\r\n<p>If a Purchase Order\'s Invoicing Control is configured From Order, the scheduler will immediately create the corresponding supplier quotation request. It might have been better to delay it for several weeks, if you could have used the lead time to group the purchase with other future orders.</p>\r\n<p>So the negative effects of working with the <code>Just in Time module</code> are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Poor priority management between orders,</li>\r\n<li>Additionally stocked products.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><a name=\"logistic\">Logistics Configuration through Advanced Routes</a></h2>\r\n<p>To configure your logistics for advanced push and pull, you need to install <code>stock_location</code> module as explained before. A complete scenario will be developed at the end of this chapter.</p>\r\n<p>This module supplements the <code>Warehouse</code> application by adding support for location paths per product, effectively implementing Push and Pull inventory flows.</p>\r\n<p>Typically this could be used to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Manage product manufacturing chains,</li>\r\n<li>Manage default locations per product,</li>\r\n<li>Define routes within your warehouse according to business needs, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Quality Control</li>\r\n<li>After Sales Services</li>\r\n<li>Supplier Returns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Help rental management, by generating automated return moves for rented products.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once this module is installed, an additional Logistics Flows tab appears in the Product form, allowing you to add Push and Pull flow specifications.</p>\r\n<h3>Push Flow</h3>\r\n<p>Push flows are useful when the arrival of certain products in a given location should always be followed by a corresponding move to another location, optionally after a certain delay.</p>\r\n<p>The core <code>Warehouse Management</code> application already supports such Push Flow specifications on the Locations, but these cannot be refined per product.</p>\r\n<p>A push flow specification indicates which location is chained with another location, as well as the parameters used. As soon as a given quantity of products is moved to the source location, a chained move is automatically foreseen according to the parameters set on the flow specification (destination location, delay, type of move, journal, etc.) The new move may be processed automatically, or may require a manual confirmation, according to what you have defined.</p>\r\n<p>Suppose whenever the demo data product CPUi5 enters the Stock location, it first has to be moved to the Quality Control location in order to check the quality.</p>\r\n<p>Look up the product CPUi5 using the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Products &gt; Products</code>.</p>\r\n<p>To have Odoo accomplish this move automatically, you have to configure the Push flow as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Operation</code>: Receptions to Quality Control</li>\r\n<li><code>Source Location</code>: Stock</li>\r\n<li><code>Destination Location</code>: Quality Control</li>\r\n<li><code>Automatic Move</code>: Automatic No Step Added</li>\r\n<li><code>Delay (days)</code>: 1</li>\r\n<li><code>Shipping Type</code>: Getting Goods</li>\r\n<li><code>Invoice Status</code>: Not Applicable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_pushed_flow.png\" alt=\"stock pushed flow\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Push Flow Specification for Product CPUi5</code></em></p>\r\n<p>A push flow is related to how stock moves should be generated in order to increase or decrease inventory.</p>\r\n<h3>Pull Flow</h3>\r\n<p>Pull flows are a bit different from Push flows, in the sense that they are not related to the processing of product moves, but rather to the processing of procurement orders. What is being pulled is a need, not directly products.</p>\r\n<p>A classical example of a Pull flow is when you have an Outlet company, with a parent Company that is responsible for the supplies of the Outlet.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>[ Customer ] &lt;- A - [ Outlet ] &lt;- B - [ Holding ] &lt;- C - [ Supplier ]</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>When a new procurement order A (resulting from the confirmation of a Sales Order, for example) is created in the Outlet (Your Company, Chicago shop), it is converted into another procurement B (through a Pull flow of the \'move\' type) requested from the Holding. When procurement order B is processed by the Holding company (Your Company), and if the product is out of stock, it may be converted into a Purchase Order (C) from the Supplier (Push flow of the \'Buy\' type). The result is that the procurement order, the need, is pushed all the way between the Customer and Supplier.</p>\r\n<p>Technically, Pull flows allow to process procurement orders differently, not only depending on the product being considered, but also depending on which location holds the \"need\" for that product (i.e. the destination location of that procurement order).</p>\r\n<p>To explain a pull flow for the product CPUa8, we first have to configure the Reordering rules of CPUa8 for the company Your Company and Your Company, Chicago shop using the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Configuration &gt; Reordering Rules</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Reordering Rules</p>\r\n<p>For the company Your Company:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Min Quantity: 10</li>\r\n<li>Max Quantity: 50</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For the company Your Company Chicago shop;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Min Quantity: 10</li>\r\n<li>Max Quantity: 20</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Look up the product CPUa8 using menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Products &gt; Products</code> in order to define the configuration of the pulled flow.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_pulled_flow.png\" alt=\"stock pulled flow\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Pull Flow Specification for Product CPUa8</em></p>\r\n<p>There are two specifications of a pull flow for product CPUa8.</p>\r\n<p>Specification 1:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Name</code>: Receive from Warehouse</li>\r\n<li><code>Destination Location</code>: Shop 1</li>\r\n<li><code>Type of Procurement</code>: Move</li>\r\n<li><code>Source Location</code>: Internal Shippings</li>\r\n<li><code>Partner Address</code>: OpenERP S.A., Belgium Gerompont Chaussee de Namur 40</li>\r\n<li><code>Shipping Type</code>: Getting Goods</li>\r\n<li><code>Procure Method</code>: Make to Order</li>\r\n<li><code>Invoice Status</code>: Not Applicable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Specification 2:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Name</code>: Deliver Shop</li>\r\n<li><code>Destination Location</code>: Internal Shippings</li>\r\n<li><code>Type of Procurement</code>: Move</li>\r\n<li><code>Source Location</code>: Stock</li>\r\n<li><code>Partner Address</code>: Fabien</li>\r\n<li><code>Shipping Type</code>: Sending Goods</li>\r\n<li><code>Procure Method</code>: Make to Stock</li>\r\n<li><code>Invoice Status</code>: Not Applicable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Now sell 1 unit of product CPUa8 from the Your Company Chicago shop (do not forget to confirm your sales order) and run the scheduler using the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Schedulers &gt; Run Schedulers</code>. Then check the stock moves for product CPUa8 from the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Traceability &gt; Stock Moves</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_move_pull_flow.png\" alt=\"stock move pull flow\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Stock Move of CPUa8 related to Pull Flow Specification</code></em></p>\r\n<p>These moves can be explained like this:</p>\r\n<p>[ Customer ] &lt;-- [ Your Company Chicago shop ] &lt;-- Internal Shippings &lt;-- Stock &lt;-- [ Your Company ]</p>\r\n<p>When the company Your Company Chicago shop sells one unit of CPUa8 to a customer, its stock decreases to 10 units. According to the minimum stock rule of the product CPUa8, Odoo generates a procurement order of 21 units of CPUa8 for the company Your Company Chicago shop (OUT/00020, or another number if you have added extra data). So 21 units of CPUa8 move from Your Company Stock to Your Company Chicago shop according to their internal configuration of Source and Destination Locations.</p>\r\n<p>A pull flow is related to how the procurement process runs in order to find products to increase or decrease inventory.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"procutement\">Procurement Methods – Make to Stock and Make to Order</a></h2>\r\n<p>The procurement method determines how the product will be replenished:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Make to Stock</code>: your customers are supplied from available stock. If the quantities in stock are too low to fulfil the order, a Purchase Order (according the minimum stock rules) will be generated in order to get the products required. Example: a classic distributor.</li>\r\n<li><code>Make to Order</code>: when a customer order is confirmed, you procure or manufacture the products for this order. A customer order \'Make to Order\' will not modify stock in the medium term because you restock with the exact amount that was ordered. Example: computers from a large supplier assembled on demand.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You find a mix of these two modes used for the different final and intermediate products in most industries. The procurement method shown on the product form is a default value for the order, enabling the salesperson to choose the best mode for fulfilling a particular order by varying the sales order parameters as needed.</p>\r\n<p>The figures Change in Stock for a <code>Make to Stock</code> Product and Change in Stock for a <code>Make to Order</code> Product show the change of stock levels for one product managed as <code>Make to Order</code> and another managed as <code>Make to Stock</code>.</p>\r\n<p>These figures are taken from, product view (In product go to More -&gt; Future Stock Moves)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_from_stock.png\" alt=\"stock from stock\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Change in Stock for a Make to Stock Product</code></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/stock_from_order.png\" alt=\"stock from order\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Change in Stock for a Make to Order Product</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The <code>Make to Stock</code> logistical approach is usually used for high volumes and when the demand is seasonal or otherwise easy to forecast. The <code>Make to Order</code> approach is used for products that are measured, or very expensive to stock or have a short restocking time.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"supply\">Choosing Supply Methods</a></h2>\r\n<p>Odoo supports two supply methods:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Manufacture</code>: when the product is manufactured or the service is supplied from internal resources.</li>\r\n<li><code>Buy</code>: when the product is bought from a supplier.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These are just the default settings used by the system during automated replenishment. The same product can be either manufactured internally or bought from a supplier.</p>\r\n<p>These three fields (<code>Supply Method</code>, <code>Procurement Method</code>, <code>Product Type</code>) determine the system\'s behaviour when a product is required. The system will generate different documents depending on the configuration of these three fields when satisfying an order, a price quotation to a supplier or a manufacturing order.</p>\r\n<p>Odoo manages both stockable products and services. A service bought from a supplier in <code>Make to Order</code> mode, will generate a subcontract order from the supplier in question.</p>\r\n<p>The table below shows all possible cases for Procurement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Consequences of Procurement Methods Make to Stock (MTS) and Make To Order (MTO)</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><th class=\"head\">Procurement Method</th><th class=\"head\">Produce</th><th class=\"head\">Buy</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sbd205ff8be0644b8ad438d848ab7dc9b\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">MTS</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s9e74bcdd1e0949a3a73acc1839441e23\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Wait for availability</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s2c98e9974602433db7fe8c4cca70b5ec\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Wait for availability</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s05aa91bd632d4e49885428a3bfbe3fdd\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">MTO</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"scbb6779d04ad4923b637f86d06bdc846\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Production Order</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sfdb08c7efb384d8ab8d5bbf045adf71a\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Purchase Order</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Consequences of Procurement Methods when using Services</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><th class=\"head\">Procurement Method</th><th class=\"head\">Produce</th><th class=\"head\">Buy</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s87bbd1db075b41ff94d5e88345fac650\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">MTS</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sc3bb52b710e84ffeaee9b22d0bca323f\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">/</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sd6a11bccbfcf40a4a3f5d381b84b1880\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">/</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s6fabe611bb46429585a8dd3f2d16c0fa\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">MTO</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sa100d05982c4485bb42c7aecffd95d71\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Create task</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sef412021f082457fadb861402b976048\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Subcontract</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"packaging\">Packaging with Various Logistics Units of Measure</a></h2>\r\n<h3>Units of Measure</h3>\r\n<p>Odoo supports several units of measure.

A product in the Weight category could be expressed in Kg, Tonnes or Grammes. You cannot express it in hours or pieces, for example.</p>\r\n<p>Use the menu <code>Warehouse &gt; Configuration &gt; Units of Measure</code> to define a new unit of measure.</p>\r\n<p>In the definition of a Unit of Measure, you have a <code>Rounding</code> precision factor which shows how amounts are rounded after the conversion. A value of 1 gives rounding to the level of one unit. 0.01 gives rounding to one hundredth.</p>\r\n<p>Odoo supports double units of measure. Notice however that the default unit of measure and the purchase unit of measure have to be in the same category. Only the sales unit of measure may be in a different category.</p>\r\n<p>This is very useful in the agro-food industry, for example: you sell ham by the piece, but invoice by the Kg. A weighing operation is needed before invoicing the customer.</p>\r\n<p>To activate the management options for double units of measure, you have to change configuration from <code>Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Warehouse</code>.</p>\r\n<p>In this case, the same product can be expressed in two units of measure belonging to different categories for sales and stock/purchase. You can then distinguish between the unit of stock management (the piece) and the unit of invoicing or sales (kg) in the <code>Sales</code> tab of Product form.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/UOM_UOS.png\" alt=\"UOM UOS\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Secondary Unit of Measure</code></em></p>\r\n<p>In the product form you can set one unit of measure for sales and stock management, and one unit of measure for purchases (in Procrument tab of Product form).</p>\r\n<p>For each operation on a product, you can use another unit of measure, as long as it can be found in the same category as the two units already defined. If you use another unit of measure, Odoo automatically handles the conversion of prices and quantities.</p>\r\n<p>So if you have 430 Kg of carrots at 5.30 EUR/Kg, Odoo will automatically make the conversion if you want to sell in tonnes – 0.43 tonnes at 5300 EUR / tonne. If you had set a rounding factor of 0.1 for the <code>tonne</code> unit of measure, Odoo will tell you that you have only 0.4 tonnes available.</p>\r\n<h3>Packaging</h3>\r\n<p>The packaging allows you to ship products in several ways. For example, you can ship goods by boxes or by pallets.</p>\r\n<p>At first, you have to define possible packaging.

This feature is available if you have installed the module mrp_byproducts, which can be done by selecting <code>Produce several products from one manufacturing order</code> in the <code>Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Manufacturing</code> in Order.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mrp_bom_subproduct.png\" alt=\"mrp bom subproduct\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>By Products of a Bill of Materials</code></em></p>\r\n<p>In the third tab, <code>Properties</code>, you can put a free text reference to a plan, a sequence number that is used to determine the priorities between bills of materials, dates between which a bill of materials is valid, and values for rounding and production efficiency.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/mrp_bom_properties.png\" alt=\"mrp bom properties\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Properties of a Bill of Materials</code></em></p>\r\n<p><code>Rounding</code> is used to set the smallest <code>Unit of Measure</code> in which the quantities of the selected product can be expressed. So if you set the rounding to 1.00, you will not be able to manufacture half a piece. The <code>Efficiency</code> of the product lets you indicate the percentage you lose during manufacturing. This loss can be defined for the finished product or for each raw materials (components) line. The impact of this efficiency figure is that Odoo will reserve more raw materials for manufacturing than you would otherwise use just from the Bill of Materials calculations.</p>\r\n<p>The final part of this tab lets you set some properties for the product\'s manufacturing processes. These will be detailed further on in the chapter in the section about configurable products.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"multibom\">Multi-level Bills of Materials</a></h2>\r\n<p>In Odoo, each line of a bill of materials may itself be a bill of materials. This allows you to define BoMs with several levels. Instead of defining several BoMs for the shelf in the figure Plan of Construction of a Shelf, you could define the single bill of materials below:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Single Bill of Materials for 1 SHE100 Unit</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\"><th class=\"head\">Product Ref.</th><th class=\"head\">Quantity</th><th class=\"head\">Unit of Measure</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sd237240aa9c041deae5bf837e17c187b\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">SHE100</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s2edd227a6f844ff0a0b214722f613b0b\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">1</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s3d347db3130f45adb28a31985ba97253\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Unit(s)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s632ec92686904819a2a95925640b8592\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">SIDEPAN</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sfbc11320e91c4766b382f0fb30763cb0\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">2</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s0050e442e16b47b4a20f47e5c6ab4d24\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Unit(s)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s9462f1519d794a3eb1e2f249471d2c7e\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">WOOD002</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s0f40ce4d8476407d818c60984280ccd4\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">0.166</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s999e373d06c640c6a60eb292b547c492\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">m</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sdf2f68c912094160a700ea0dd4946283\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">RPAN100</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s76175da3f2884729a96b0c18e7e5f1fc\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">1</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sead035eba56144d7bbdc2d0f7d2d6d31\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Unit(s)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sb3fa2f1ce95148e08f45a624722fbde1\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">WOOD002</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s7e5089969b6548b5bf7f622c472456d1\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">0.25</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s9efc09e9ef424373ab05ee549ed8b385\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">m</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sf52142ac60bd407e879308e789ee85ac\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">PROFIL</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sbb1d62ba22d24bf6b2cc12fcf5ecc000\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">4</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sf1afc9e792694ddc9645585beb7b92b5\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Unit(s)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s0d41bc6ab6024284b61c59d9c476bb64\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">LIN40</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"scd5bc40213c64d5aabedf1713d4cc749\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">1</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s3bc89f9c6fd842c389b3332c83b5ec2e\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">m</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s2f1998d21f4b4f46ba90e44db2e2daf0\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">RCK100</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s886a70c1d5c1419a81b78f23f95a98f1\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">3</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sc9691f70761d4977b21cd7e7bc0db030\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Unit(s)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s486a9de2382642d3817b44c456219704\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">SPAN100</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"see3f4fa68f8c47d887a1e53e8aa24d10\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">3</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sb05e0feee9ec4783b22e27c244bc5afb\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Unit(s)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-odd\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s435403483cfc487b87069054856ca669\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">WOOD010</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s20baebf4e819480ea961e2cadd3018aa\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">0.249</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s6aa0c22cdf0b4f388158d17cf9f09620\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">m</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"row-even\">\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"se50c30ca29ac4ac5a8bc2bb11d4bba94\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">METC000</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"sfc4a3b5a391d428ca541845ac280664e\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">132</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p id=\"s2d4efd7af3474cb9bbf53fedf6c59749\" class=\"first last sphinx-has-comment\">Unit(s)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Odoo behaves differently depending on whether the bill of materials is defined in several small BoMs each on a single level or in one BoM tree-structured on several levels.</p>\r\n<p>If you select a BoM using intermediate products that automatically generates production orders based on calculated requirements, Odoo will propose to manufacture an intermediate product.

intermediate products that are themselves defined using other BoMs, Odoo will propose to manufacture each intermediate product. This will result in several production orders. If you only want a single production order, you can define a single BoM with several levels.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, however, it may be useful to define the intermediate product separately and not as part of a multi-level assembly, even if you do not want separate production orders for intermediate products.</p>\r\n<p>In the example, the intermediate product <code>RCK100</code> is used in the manufacturing of different shelves (<code>SHE100</code>, <code>SHE200</code>, ...). So you would prefer to define a unique BoM for it, even though you do not want any instances of this product to be built, nor would you want to rewrite these elements in a series of different multi-level BoMs.</p>\r\n<p>If you only want a single production order for the complete shelf, and not one for the BoM itself, you can define the BoM line corresponding to product <code>RCK100</code> in the shelf\'s BoM as type <code>Sets/Phantom</code>. Then Odoo will automatically put <code>RCK100\'s BoM</code> contents into the shelf\'s production order, even though it has been defined as multi-level.</p>\r\n<p>This way of representing the assembly is very useful, because it allows you to define reusable assembly elements and keep them isolated.</p>\r\n<p>If you define the BoM for the <code>SHE100</code> shelf in the way shown by the table below, you will get two production orders on confirmation of a sales order, as also shown in the tables.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Defining and Using Phantom

In Odoo, you can handle bank statements and also a cash register. Use different journals for these two kinds of transaction. According to the journal type selected, you will have a different screen.For more information about creating journals, refer to the <a href=\"index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=95:configuring-accounts-from-a-to-z&amp;catid=27:accounting-financial&amp;lang=en-GB&amp;Itemid=213\" target=\"_blank\">Configuring Accounts from A to Z</a> chapter.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"bank\">Managing Bank Statements</a></h2>\r\n<p>Odoo provides a visual tool for managing bank statements that simplifies data entry into accounts. As soon as a statement is validated, the corresponding accounting entries are automatically generated by Odoo. So non-accounting people can enter financial transactions without having to worry about things such as credit, debit and counterparts.</p>\r\n<p>To enter a bank statement, go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Bank and Cash &gt; Bank Statements</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_statement.png\" alt=\"account statement\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Data Entry Form for a Bank Statement</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The statement reference <code>Name</code> and the Date are automatically suggested by Odoo. The <code>Name</code> will be filled with the statement number at confirmation of the bank statement. You can configure your own reference by managing sequences in the <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Sequences &amp; Identifiers &gt; Sequences</code> menu.</p>\r\n<p>Then select the correct Journal. Ideally, when you are configuring your company, you would create at least one journal for each bank account and one journal for petty cash in your company. So select the journal corresponding to the bank account whose statement you are handling.</p>\r\n<p>The currency that you are using for the statement line is that of the selected journal. If you are entering statement lines for an account in American Dollars (USD), the amounts must be entered in USD . The currency is automatically converted into the company\'s main currency when you confirm the entry, using the rates in effect at the date of entry. (This means that you would need valid currency conversion rates to be created first. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Currencies</code> menu.)</p>\r\n<p>Odoo automatically completes the initial balance based on the closing balance of the preceding statement. You can modify this value and force another value. This lets you enter statements in the order of your choice. Also if you have lost a page of your statement, you can enter the following ones immediately and you are not forced to wait for a duplicate from the bank.</p>\r\n<p>So, complete the closing balance which corresponds to the new value in the account displayed on your bank statement. This amount will be used to control the operations before approving the statement.</p>\r\n<p>Then you must enter all the lines on the statement. Each line corresponds to a banking transaction.</p>\r\n<p>Enter the transaction line. You have two ways of entering financial transactions: manually or through the Import Invoices button.</p>\r\n<h3>Manual Entry</h3>\r\n<p>When you type the Partner name, Odoo automatically proposes the corresponding centralisation account. The total amount due for the customer or supplier is pre-completed (<code>Amount</code>). This gives you a simple indication of the effective payment. You must then enter the amount that appears on your statement line: a negative sign for a withdrawal and a positive sign for a cash payment or deposit.</p>\r\n<h3>Import Invoices</h3>\r\n<p>Click the Import <code>Invoices</code> button, then click <code>Add</code> to select the invoices for which your payment will have to be reconciled. Click select to confirm your selection; the statement line will automatically be added with the corresponding reconciliation.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_statement_reconcile.png\" alt=\"account statement reconcile\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Reconciliation from Data Entry of the Bank Statement</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Other methods of reconciliation are possible: from accounting entries, when saving the payment directly on an invoice, or using the automatic reconciliation tool.</p>\r\n<p>You can carry out either a full or a partial reconciliation. If you see a difference between the payment and the invoices to reconcile, you can enter the difference in the second part of the form <code>Write-off</code>. You have to set an account for the adjustment. The main reasons explaining the difference are usually:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Profit or Loss.</li>\r\n<li>Exchange differences.</li>\r\n<li>Discounts given for fast payment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When the reconciliation is complete - that is, the payment is equal to the sum of the due payments and the adjustments - you can close the reconciliation form.</p>\r\n<p>The reconciliation operation is optional – you could very well do it later or not do it at all. However, reconciliation has got two significant effects:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Marking that the invoices have been paid.</li>\r\n<li>Preventing the payment and invoice amounts from appearing on customer reminder letters. Unless you have reconciled them, a customer will see the invoice and payment amounts on his reminder letter (which will not alter the balance due since they will just cancel each other out).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Finally, once you have entered the complete bank statement, you can validate it. Odoo then automatically generates the corresponding accounting entries if the calculated balance equals the final balance, indicated in the <code>Closing Balance</code> field. The reconciled invoices are marked as paid at that point.</p>\r\n<p>You can also enter general accounting entries, for example, banking costs. In such cases, you can enter the amounts directly in the corresponding general accounts.</p>\r\n<p>A user with advanced accounting skills can enter accounting entries directly into the bank journal from <code>Accounting &gt; Journal Entries &gt; Journal Items</code>. The result is the same, but the operation is more complex because you must know the accounts to use and must have mastered the ideas of credit and debit.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"cash\">Cash Management</a></h2>\r\n<p>To manage cash, you can use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Bank and Cash &gt; Cash Registers</code>. At the start of the day you set the opening amount of cash in the entry (Opening Balance). Then click on button <code>Open CashBox</code>, after you can start making entries from the <code>Cash Transactions</code> tab.</p>\r\n<p>You have to go menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals</code> and open the cash journal , then go to the <code>Cash Register</code> tab of form and select option Opening With Last Losing Balance and <code>Cash</code> Control.</p>\r\n<p>Because if you do not select that options , than you will find <code>Opening Cash Control</code> field 0.00 of Cash Register form. So first you have to configure Journal.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_cash_registers.png\" alt=\"account cash registers\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Defining the Cash Register</code></em></p>\r\n<p>All the transactions throughout the day are then entered in this statement. When you close the cashbox, generally at the end of the day, enter the amounts on the <code>Cash Control</code> tab, in the Closing Balance section. Then confirm the statement to close the day\'s cash statement and automatically generate the corresponding accounting entries. Note that the <code>Calculated Balance</code> and the <code>CashBox Balance</code> need to be equal before you can close the cashbox.</p>\r\n<p>Accounting entries are only generated when the cash statement is confirmed. So if the total statement has not been approved (that is to say during the day, in the case of petty cash), partner payments will not have been deducted from their corresponding account.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"manualentry\">Manual Entry in a Journal</a></h2>\r\n<p>Invoices and statements produce accounting entries in different journals. But you could also create entries directly in a journal (line by line) without using the dedicated journal views. This functionality is often used for miscellaneous entries.</p>\r\n<p>To make manual entries, go to the following menu <code>Accounting &gt; Journal Entries &gt; Journal Items</code>. In the Journal field from the filter, select the journal in which you want to post. When you select a journal in this filter, you do not have to fill in the journal when posting new entries.</p>\r\n<p>Let us give the example of a purchase invoice. Note, however, that these entries are usually generated automatically by Odoo.</p>\r\n<p>Click the Create button. Fill these fields manually in the following order:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Reference</code>: reference from the invoice or entry.</li>\r\n<li><code>Effective date</code>: effective date of the entry, will be preset with today\'s date.</li>\r\n<li><code>Period</code>: financial period, will be preset with the current period.</li>\r\n<li><code>Partner</code>: partner concerned.</li>\r\n<li><code>Account</code>: general account (e.g. purchase account Products Purchase).</li>\r\n<li><code>Name</code>: description of the invoice line (e.g. PC2).</li>\r\n<li><code>Debit</code>: here you type the debit amount.</li>\r\n<li><code>Journal</code>: here you select the journal in which you want to post.</li>\r\n<li><code>Credit</code>: here you type the credit amount, e.g. 1196.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Press the <code>Enter</code> key on your keyboard to validate the first line. The next draft move number is assigned to your accounting entry. Your line is then colored red and takes the <code>Unbalanced</code> state. When a line is in the draft state, it is not yet reflected in the accounts. Odoo will not validate that line until the balancing entry is made (so the credit amounts must balance the debit amounts for that set of entries).</p>\r\n<p>Odoo now proposes the balancing accounting line to be filled in. If the account used (in this case account 600000) includes taxes by default Odoo automatically proposes taxes associated with the amount entered. At this stage you can modify and validate this second line of the account, or replace it with other information such as a second purchase line.</p>\r\n<p>When you have entered all of the data from your lines, Odoo automatically proposes counterpart entries to you, based on the credit entries.</p>\r\n<p>When an accounting entry is matched, Odoo moves it to the <code>Valid</code> state automatically and prepares to enter the next data. Do not forget to definitely post the valid entries by clicking the Action button and selecting <code>Post Journal Entries</code>.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to add some other balancing lines you can enter the number of the entry on the new line that you are entering. In such a case the whole line stays Draft until the whole set balances to zero.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"reconciliation\">Reconciliation Process</a></h2>\r\n<p>The reconciliation operation consists of matching entries in different accounts to indicate that they are related. Generally reconciliation is used for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Matching invoice entries to payments, so that invoices are marked as paid and customers do not get payment reminder letters for those entries (reconciliation in a customer account).</li>\r\n<li>Matching deposits and cheque withdrawals with their respective payments.</li>\r\n<li>Matching invoices and credit notes to cancel them out.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A reconciliation must be carried out on a list of accounting entries by an accountant, so that the sum of credits equals the sum of the debits for the matched entries.</p>\r\n<p>Reconciliation in Odoo can only be carried out in accounts that have been configured as reconcilable (the <code>Reconcile</code> field).</p>\r\n<p>Do not confuse account reconciliation and bank statement reconciliation</p>\r\n<p>It is important not to confuse the reconciliation of accounting entries with bank statement reconciliation. Account reconciliation consists of linking account entries with each other, while statement reconciliation consists of verifying that your bank statement corresponds to the entries of that account in your accounting system.</p>\r\n<p>There are different methods of reconciling entries. You have already seen the reconciliation of entries while doing data entry in an account. Automatic and manual reconciliations are described here.</p>\r\n<h3>Automatic Reconciliation</h3>\r\n<p>For automatic reconciliation, you will be asking Odoo to search for entries to reconcile in a series of accounts. Odoo tries to find entries for each partner where the amounts correspond.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the level of complexity that you choose (= power) when you start running the tool, the software could reconcile from two to nine entries at the same time. For example, if you select level 5, Odoo will reconcile, for instance, three invoices and two payments if the total amounts correspond. Note that you can also choose a maximum write-off amount, if you allow payment differences to be posted.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_reconcile_auto.png\" alt=\"account reconcile auto\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Form for Automatic Reconciliation</code></em></p>\r\n<p>To start the reconciliation tool, click <code>Accounting &gt; Periodical Processing &gt; Reconciliation &gt; Automatic Reconciliation</code>. A form opens, asking you for the following information:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Add <code>Accounts to Reconcile</code>: you can select one, several or all reconcilable accounts.</li>\r\n<li>The Reconciliation <code>Power</code> (from 2 to 4).</li>\r\n<li>Checkbox <code>Allow write</code> off to determine whether you will allow for payment differences.</li>\r\n<li>Information needed for the adjustment (details for the <code>Write-Off Move</code>).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can reconcile any account, but the most common accounts are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>All the Accounts Receivable – your customer accounts of type Debtor.</li>\r\n<li>All the Accounts Payable – your supplier accounts of type Creditor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The write-off option enables you to reconcile entries even if their amounts are not exactly equivalent. For example, Odoo permits foreign customers whose accounts are in different currencies to have a difference of up to, say, 0.50 units of currency and put the difference in a write- off account.</p>\r\n<p>You should not make the adjustment limits too large. Companies that introduced substantial automatic write-off adjustments have found that all employee expense reimbursements below the limit were written off automatically!</p>\r\n<h3>Manual Reconciliation</h3>\r\n<p>For manual reconciliation, open the entries for reconciling an account through the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Periodical Processing &gt; Reconciliation &gt; Manual Reconciliation</code>.</p>\r\n<p>You can also call up manual reconciliation from any screen that shows accounting entries. Select entries that you want to reconcile. Odoo indicates the sum of debits and credits for the selected entries. When these are equal you can click the <code>Reconcile Entries</code> button to reconcile the entries.</p>\r\n<p>Suppose that you are entering customer order details. You wonder what is outstanding on the customer account (that is the list of unpaid invoices and unreconciled payments). To review it from the order form, navigate to the Partner record and select the view <code>Receivables</code> and <code>Payables</code>. Odoo opens a history of unreconciled accounting entries on screen.</p>\r\n<p>After running the <code>Reconcile Entries</code> wizard, these lines can no longer be selected and will not appear when the entries are listed again. If there is a difference between the two entries, Odoo suggests you to make an adjustment. This write-off is a compensating entry that enables a complete reconciliation. You must therefore specify the journal and the account to be used for the <code>write-off</code>.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if you want to reconcile the following entries:</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Entries for reconciliation</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr><th>Date</th><th>Ref.</th><th>Description</th><th>Account</th><th>Debit</th><th>Credit</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>12 May 11</td>\r\n<td>INV23</td>\r\n<td>Car hire</td>\r\n<td>4010</td>\r\n<td>544.50</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>25 May 11</td>\r\n<td><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">INV44</span></td>\r\n<td>Car insurance</td>\r\n<td>4010</td>\r\n<td>100.00</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>31 May 11</td>\r\n<td>PAY01</td>\r\n<td>Invoices n° 23, 44</td>\r\n<td>4010</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>644.00</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>On reconciliation, Odoo shows a difference of 0.50. At this stage you have two possibilities:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do not reconcile, and the customer receives a request for 0.50.</li>\r\n<li>Reconcile and accept an adjustment of 0.50 that you will take from the P&amp;L account.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Odoo generates the following entry automatically:</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\"><caption>Entries for reconciliation</caption>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr><th>Date</th><th>Ref.</th><th>Description</th><th>Account</th><th>Debit</th><th>Credit</th></tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>03 Jun 11</td>\r\n<td>AJ001</td>\r\n<td>Adjustment: profits and losses</td>\r\n<td>4010</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;0.50</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>03 Jun 11</td>\r\n<td>AJ001</td>\r\n<td>Adjustment: profits and losses</td>\r\n<td>XXXX</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;0.50</td>\r\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>The two invoices and the payment will be reconciled in the first adjustment line. The two invoices will then be automatically marked as paid.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"payment\">Payment Management</a></h2>\r\n<p>Odoo gives you forms to prepare, validate and execute payment orders. This enables you to manage issues such as:</p>\r\n<blockquote><ol>\r\n<li>Payment provided on several due dates.</li>\r\n<li>Automatic payment dates.</li>\r\n<li>Separating payment preparation and payment approval in your company.</li>\r\n<li>Preparing an order during the week containing several payments, then creating a payment file at the end of the week.</li>\r\n<li>Creating a file for electronic payment which can be sent to a bank for execution.</li>\r\n<li>Splitting payments depending on the balances available in your various bank accounts.</li>\r\n</ol></blockquote>\r\n<h3>How to Manage your Payment Orders?</h3>\r\n<p>To use the tool for managing payments you must first install the module <code>account_payment</code>, or Go to menu <code>Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounting in eInvoicing &amp; Payments</code> section tick <code>Manage payment orders</code>. Supplier Payments are part of the core Odoo system.</p>\r\n<p>The system lets you enter a series of payments to be carried out from your various bank accounts. Once the different payments have been registered, you can validate the payment orders. During validation you can modify and approve the payment orders, sending the order to the bank for electronic funds transfer.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if you have to pay a supplier\'s invoice for a large amount you can split the payments amongst several bank accounts according to their available balance. To do this, you can prepare several draft orders and validate them once you are satisfied that the split is correct.</p>\r\n<p>This process can also be regularly scheduled. In some companies, a payment order is kept in <code>Draft</code> state and payments are added to the draft list each day. At the end of the week, the accountant reviews and confirms all the waiting payment orders.</p>\r\n<p>Once the payment order is confirmed, there is still a validation step for an accountant to carry out. You could imagine that these orders would be prepared by an accounts clerk, and then approved by a manager to go ahead with payment.</p>\r\n<p>An Odoo workflow is associated with each payment order. Select a payment order, and if you are in the developer mode Click on Debug View# and then select print workflow to print the payment order workflow.</p>\r\n<p>You can integrate more complex workflow rules to manage payment orders by adapting the workflow. For example, in some companies payments must be approved by a manager under certain cash flow or value limit conditions</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_payment_workflow.png\" alt=\"account payment workflow\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Payments Workflow</code></em></p>\r\n<p>In small businesses it is usually the same person who enters the payment orders and who validates them. In this case you should just click the two buttons, one after the other, to confirm the payment.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"transfer\">Prepare and Transfer Orders</a></h2>\r\n<p>To enter a payment order, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Payment &gt; Payment Orders</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_payment_order.png\" alt=\"account payment order class=\" img-thumbnail=\"\" img-responsive=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Entering a Payment Order</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Odoo then proposes a reference number for your payment order.</p>\r\n<p>You then have to choose a payment mode from the various methods available to your company. These have to be configured when you set up the accounting system using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Payment Mode</code>. Some examples are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cheques.</li>\r\n<li>Bank transfer.</li>\r\n<li>Visa card on a bank account.</li>\r\n<li>Petty cash.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Then, you set the Preferred date for payment:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Due date</code>: each operation will be effected at the invoice deadline date.</li>\r\n<li><code>Directly</code>: the operations will be effected when the orders are validated.</li>\r\n<li><code>Fixed date</code>: you must specify an effective payment date in the Scheduled date if fixed field that follows.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The date is particularly important for the preparation of electronic transfers, because banking interfaces enable you to select a future execution date for each operation. So to configure your Odoo, most simply you can choose to pay all invoices automatically by their deadline.</p>\r\n<p>You must then select the invoices to pay. They can be entered manually in the field <code>Payment Line</code>, but it is easier to add them automatically. For that, click <code>Select Invoices to Pay</code> and Odoo will then propose lines with payment deadlines. For each deadline you can see:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The invoice <code>Payment Date</code>.</li>\r\n<li>The reference <code>Invoice Ref</code>.</li>\r\n<li>The deadline for the invoice.</li>\r\n<li>The amount to be paid in the partner\'s default currency.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can then accept the payment proposed by Odoo, or select the entries that you will pay or not pay on that order. Odoo gives you all the necessary information to make a payment decision for each line item:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Account.</li>\r\n<li>Supplier\'s bank account.</li>\r\n<li>Amount that will be paid.</li>\r\n<li>Amount to pay.</li>\r\n<li>The supplier.</li>\r\n<li>Total amount owed to the supplier.</li>\r\n<li>Due date.</li>\r\n<li>Date of creation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can modify the first three fields on each line: the account, the supplier\'s bank account and the amount that will be paid. This arrangement is very practical because it gives you complete visibility of all the company\'s trade payables. You can pay only a part of an invoice, for example, and in preparing your next payment order Odoo automatically suggests payment of the remainder owed.</p>\r\n<p>When the payment has been prepared correctly, click <code>Confirm Payments</code>. The payment then changes to the <code>Confirmed</code> state and a new button appears that can be used to start the payment process.</p>\r\n<p>You can print the payment order to send it to the bank by clicking the <code>Print &gt; Payment Order</code> at the top of the screen.</p>', '1', '27', '2015-08-13 12:10:23', '836', '', '2015-08-15 01:28:06', '836', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-08-13 12:10:23', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}', '14', '4', '', 'This section deals with: managing bank statements, managing cash, manual journal entries.', '1', '3830', '{\"robots\":\"\",\"author\":\"\",\"rights\":\"\",\"xreference\":\"\"}', '0', 'en-GB', ''), ('95', '267', 'Configuring Accounts from A to Z', 'configuring-accounts-from-a-to-z', '<p>Accounts have be configured to meet your company\'s needs. This chapter explains how to modify your chart of accounts, journals, access rights, initial account balances and default values for the initial configuration of your Odoo accounts.</p>\r\n<p>Good accounting software requires great usability and simplicity of data entry, as well as flexibility in configuring its different components. You should be able to easily modify the accounting module to meet your own needs, so that you can optimise it for the way you want to use it.</p>\r\n', '\r\n<h2><a name=\"chartofaccount\">Chart of Accounts</a></h2>\r\n<p>When configuring the software, Odoo allows you to choose predefined charts of accounts, which include all basic configuration, such as tax codes and fiscal positions. Of course, you can also define your own chart of accounts.</p>\r\n<h3>Using a Preconfigured Chart of Accounts</h3>\r\n<p>You can install a chart from the list of modules too. The module name will be like <code>l10n_XX</code> where <code>XX</code> represents your country code in two letters. For example, to get the chart of accounts for New Zealand, go to <code>Settings &gt; Modules &gt; Modules</code> and install the module <code>l10n_nz</code>.</p>\r\n<p>Some of these pre-defined charts of accounts are comprehensive and accurate, others rather have a more tentative status and are simply indicators of the possibilities. You can modify these, or build your own accounts onto the default chart, or replace it entirely with a custom chart.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_chart_module.png\" alt=\"account chart module\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Set Your Accounting Options</code></em></p>\r\n<h3>Creating a Chart of Accounts</h3>\r\n<p>Start by creating <code>Account Types</code>, which determine the kind of account and the way in which accounts will be treated at financial year closing.</p>\r\n<p>For Access the Account Type, you have to assign <code>Technical Features</code> from <code>Settings &gt; Users &gt; Users</code>.</p>\r\n<p>To add, modify or delete existing account types, go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Account Types</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_type_copy.png\" alt=\"account type\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Defining Account Types</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The fields used to define an account type are the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Account Type</code>: the name of the account type.</li>\r\n<li><code>Code</code>: the code of the account type.</li>\r\n<li><code>PL/BS Category</code>: this category determines where in a report the account will be printed (i.e. Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss). There are five types you can use: No type at all (/), Balance Sheet (Assets Accounts = active), Balance Sheet (Liabilities Accounts = passive), Profit &amp; Loss (Income) and Profit &amp; Loss (Expense).</li>\r\n<li><code>Deferral Method</code>: this field indicates how and whether the account will be transferred at financial year closing.\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>None</code> means that the account will not be transferred. Typically used for profit and loss accounts.</li>\r\n<li><code>Balance</code> means that the account balance will be transferred at year closing. Typically used for balance sheet accounts.</li>\r\n<li><code>Detail</code> means that every single entry will be transferred to the next financial year.</li>\r\n<li><code>Unreconciled</code> means that only unreconciled (outstanding) entries will be transferred to the next financial year. Typically used for centralisation accounts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Use the View type for accounts that make up the structure of the charts and have no account data inputs of their own. To add, modify or delete existing accounts, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Accounts</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_form.png\" alt=\"account form\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Defining Accounts</code></em></p>\r\n<p>The main account fields are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Account Code</code> and <code>Name</code>: the code length is not limited to a specific number of digits. Use code 0 to indicate the root account and the account name.</li>\r\n<li><code>Parent</code>: determines which account is the parent of this one, to create the tree structure of the chart of accounts.</li>\r\n<li><code>Internal Type</code>: internal types have special effects in Odoo. By default, the following types are available: <code>View</code> can be used to create a hierarchical structure for your accounts (grouping), <code>Regular</code> any account that does not fit into one of the other types; most of the accounts will have this type, <code>Receivable</code> - <code>Payable</code>: these types are used to indicate the centralisation accounts (for customers and suppliers) that will be set for each partner, <code>Liquidity</code> used to indicate financial accounts (bank and cash accounts), Consolidation to create a virtual (or consolidation) chart of accounts, Closed to indicate accounts that are no longer used.</li>\r\n<li><code>Account Type</code>: it is important to select the corresponding account type, as explained above. This will have an impact at year closing and also when printing reports.</li>\r\n<li><code>Secondary Currency</code>: forces all the moves for this account to have this secondary currency. Note that you can also define exchange rates from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Currencies</code>.</li>\r\n<li><code>Outgoing Currencies Rate</code>: to be selected only when you add a secondary currency. You have two options for outgoing transactions: At Date or Average Rate. Incoming transactions are always calculated At Date, according to the date of the transaction.</li>\r\n<li><code>Allow Reconciliation</code>: determines if you can reconcile the entries in this account. Activate this field for receivable and payable accounts and any other account that need to be reconciled other than by bank statements.</li>\r\n<li><code>Default Taxes</code>: this is the default tax applied to purchases or sales using this account. It enables the system to propose tax entries automatically when entering data in a journal manually.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The tree structure of the accounts can be altered as often and as much as you wish without recalculating any of the individual entries. So you can easily restructure your account during the year to reflect the reality of the company better.</p>\r\n<p>You can have a look at active charts of accounts using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Chart of Accounts</code>, and <code>Open Charts</code> for the selected year, account moves and periods. Click an account to drill down to its details.</p>\r\n<p>Most accounting software packages represent their charts of accounts in the form of a list. You can do this in Odoo as well if you want to, but its tree view offers several advantages:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It lets you show in detail only the accounts that interest you.</li>\r\n<li>It enables you to get a global view of accounts (when you show only summary accounts).</li>\r\n<li>It is more intuitive, because you can search for accounts on the basis of their classification.</li>\r\n<li>It is flexible because you can easily restructure them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The structure of the chart of accounts is hierarchical, with account subtotals calculated from the <code>View</code> accounts. You can develop a set of view accounts to contain only those elements that interest you.</p>\r\n<p>To get the details of the account entries that are important to you, all you need to do is click the account\'s code or name.</p>\r\n<p>Displaying the chart of accounts can take several seconds, because Odoo calculates the debits, credits and balance for each account in real time.</p>\r\n<h3>Virtual Charts of Accounts</h3>\r\n<p>The structure of a chart of accounts is imposed by the legislation in effect in the country concerned. Unfortunately, that structure does not always correspond to the view that a company needs.</p>\r\n<p>In Odoo, you can use the concept of virtual charts of accounts to manage several representations of the same accounts simultaneously. These representations can be shown in real time with no additional data entry.</p>\r\n<p>So your general chart of accounts can be the one imposed by the statutes of your country, and your CEO can then have other virtual charts as necessary, based on the accounts in the general chart. For example, you can create a view per department, a cash-flow and liquidity view, or consolidated accounts for different companies.</p>\r\n<p>The most interesting thing about virtual charts of accounts is that they can be used in the same way as the default chart of accounts for the whole organization. For example, you can establish budgets from your consolidated accounts or the accounts from one of your companies.</p>\r\n<p>Virtual accounts enable you to provide different representations of one or several existing charts of accounts. Creating and restructuring virtual accounts has no impact on the accounting entries. You can then use the virtual charts with no risk of altering the general chart of accounts or future accounting entries.</p>\r\n<p>Because they are used only to get a different representation of the same entries, they are very useful for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Consolidating several companies in real time.</li>\r\n<li>Reporting to a holding according to their chart of accounts.</li>\r\n<li>Depreciation calculations.</li>\r\n<li>Cash-flow views.</li>\r\n<li>Getting more useful views than those imposed.</li>\r\n<li>Presenting summary charts to other users that are appropriate to their general system rights.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>So there are good reasons for viewing the impact of financial transactions through virtual charts, such as budgets and financial indicators based on special views of the company.</p>\r\n<p>To create a new chart of accounts you should create a root account using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Accounts</code>. Your top level account should have a name, a code (different from any other code in your current chart), an <code>Internal Type</code> and <code>Account Type View</code>. Then you can choose your structure by creating other accounts of Account Type View as necessary. The <code>Internal Type</code> should be of the Consolidation type if you want to map accounts. Check your virtual structure using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Charts of Accounts</code> and select the corresponding chart in the drop-down list at the top of the screen.</p>\r\n<p>To be able to map your virtual chart of accounts to your general chart of accounts, you have to set Internal Type as <code>Consolidation</code>. From the Consolidated Children you can then map accounts or make accounts consolidate. In the <code>Consolidated Children</code>, you can add <code>View</code> accounts or normal accounts. If you add a View account to the consolidated children, Odoo will automatically include all existing and future linked accounts.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_virtual.png\" alt=\"account virtual\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Virtual Accounts Mapped to View Account</code></em></p>\r\n<p>You can then run reports such as <code>Trial Balance</code> and <code>General Ledger</code> for both your general chart of accounts and your virtual chart(s) giving you another representation of the company. All the actions and states in your general account are also available in the virtual accounts.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, you can also make virtual charts of accounts from other virtual charts. That can give an additional dimension for financial analysis. You can create an unlimited number of virtual (consolidation) charts of accounts.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"fiscalyear\">Periods and Financial Years</a></h2>\r\n<p>A fiscal year (or financial year) corresponds to twelve months for a company. In many countries, the fiscal year corresponds to a calendar year. That may not be the case in other countries.</p>\r\n<p>The financial year can be divided into monthly or three-monthly accounting periods (when you have a quarterly declaration).</p>\r\n<p>Odoo\'s management of the fiscal year is flexible enough to enable you to work on several years at the same time. This gives you several advantages, such as the possibility to create three-year budgets.</p>\r\n<h3>Defining a Period or a Financial Year</h3>\r\n<p>You can create several years in advance to define long-term budgets, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Periods &gt; Fiscal Years</code>, click on Create enter the date of the first day and the last day of your fiscal year. Then, to create the periods, click one of the two buttons depending on whether you want to create twelve 1-month or four 3-months periods:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_period.png\" alt=\"account period\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Defining a Financial Year and Periods</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Odoo automatically creates an opening period to allow you to post your outstanding balances from the previous fiscal year. Notice the Opening/Closing Period checkbox for such a period.</p>\r\n<p>To close a fiscal year you can also use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Periodical Processing &gt; End of Period &gt; Close a Period</code>.</p>\r\n<h3>Closing a Period</h3>\r\n<p>To close a financial period, for example when a tax declaration has been made, go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Periods &gt; Periods</code>, Select those period(s) which you want to close and from top centered <code>More</code> button click on <code>Close a Period</code> then select Check this box and on <code>Close Period</code> button. You can also close period from form view of Periods by clicking on Close Period button.</p>\r\n<p>The system administrator can re-open a period, which have been closed by mistake.</p>\r\n<p>When a period is closed, you can no longer create or modify any transactions in that period. Closing a period is not obligatory, and you could easily leave periods open.</p>\r\n<p>To close an accounting period you can also use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Periodical Processing &gt; End of Period &gt; Close a Period</code>.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"tax\">Managing your Tax Structure</a></h2>\r\n<p>This section deals with statutory taxes and accounts which are legally required from the company:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The taxation structure provided by Odoo .</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can attach taxes to transactions so that you can:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Add taxes to the amount you pay or receive.</li>\r\n<li>Report on the taxes in various categories that you should pay the tax authorities.</li>\r\n<li>Track taxes in your general accounts.</li>\r\n<li>Manage the payment and refund of taxes using the same mechanisms Odoo uses for other monetary transactions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Since the detailed tax structure is a mechanism for carrying out governments policies, and the collection of taxes so critical to their authorities, tax requirements and reporting can be complex. Odoo has a flexible mechanism for handling taxation that can be configured to meet the requirements of many tax jurisdictions.</p>\r\n<p>The taxation mechanism can also be used to handle other tax-like financial transactions, such as royalties to authors based on the value of transactions through an account.</p>\r\n<p>From the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Taxes</code> you can define your tax structure. Note that when you use a predefined (localised) chart of accounts, taxes will be configured as well in most cases.</p>\r\n<p>Odoo\'s tax system runs around three major concepts:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Tax Code</code> (or <code>Tax Case</code>), used for tax reporting, can be set up in a hierarchical structure so that multiple codes can be formed into trees in the same way as a <code>Chart of Accounts</code>. The Tax Codes structure is used to define your VAT return; it can be numeric and alphanumeric. You can define tax codes from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Tax Codes</code>.</li>\r\n<li><code>Taxes</code>, the basic tax object that contains the rules for calculating tax on the transaction it is attached to, linked to the <code>General Accounts</code> and to the <code>Tax Codes</code>. A tax can contain multiple child taxes and base its calculation on those taxes rather than on the base transaction, providing considerable flexibility.</li>\r\n<li>The <code>General Accounts</code>, which record the taxes owing and paid. Since the general accounts are discussed elsewhere in this part of the book and are not tax-specific, they will not be detailed in this section.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can attach zero or more <code>Purchase Taxes</code> and <code>Sale Taxes</code> items to products, so that you can account separately for purchase and sales taxes (or Input and Output VAT – where VAT is Value Added Tax). Because you can attach more than one tax, you can handle a VAT or Sales Tax separately from an Eco Tax on the same product.</p>\r\n<p>To create a new Tax Code, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Tax Codes</code>. You should define the following fields:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Tax Case Name</code>: a unique name required to identify the tax case, usually taken from your VAT return.</li>\r\n<li><code>Case Code</code>: an optional short code for the case.</li>\r\n<li><code>Parent Code</code>: a link to a parent Tax Code to create a tree structure which can be displayed from the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Chart of Taxes</code>.</li>\r\n<li><code>Not Printable in Invoice</code>: a checkbox allowing you to indicate that any taxes linked to the tax code concerned should not be printed on the invoice.</li>\r\n<li><code>Coefficient</code> for parent: choose 1.00 to add the total to the parent account or -1.00 to subtract it.</li>\r\n<li><code>Description</code>: a free text field for documentation purposes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_def_tax_code_form.png\" alt=\"account def tax code form\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Tax Code</code></em></p>\r\n<p>You can also see two read-only fields:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Period Sum</code>: a single figure showing the total accumulated on this case for the current financial period.</li>\r\n<li><code>Year Sum</code>: a single figure showing the total accumulated on this case for the financial year.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You will probably need to create two tax codes for each different tax rate that you have to define, one for the tax itself and one for the invoice amount (the so-called base code) the tax is computed from. And you will create tax codes that you will not link to any tax objects (similar to <code>General Account View</code> types) just to organise the tree (or hierarchical) structure.</p>\r\n<p>To have a look at the structure you have constructed, you can use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Chart of Taxes</code>. This tree view reflects the structure of the <code>Tax Codes</code> and shows the current tax situation for the selected period, or for the complete financial year.</p>\r\n<p>The <code>Taxes</code> defined are used to compute taxes on the transactions they are attached to, and they are linked to the corresponding <code>General Accounts</code> (usually VAT accounts) and to <code>Tax Codes</code>, both for the base amount and the tax amount.</p>\r\n<p>To create a new Tax, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Taxes</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_define_tax_form.png\" alt=\"account define tax form\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Defining Taxes</code></em></p>\r\n<p>You define the following fields:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Tax Name</code>: a unique name required for this tax (such as 21% Purchase VAT ).</li>\r\n<li><code>Tax Code</code>: an optional code for this tax (such as VAT IN IC ).</li>\r\n<li><code>Tax Application</code>: defines whether the tax is applicable to Sale, Purchase or All transactions.</li>\r\n<li><code>Tax Included in Price</code>: when checked, the price shown in the product or invoice is inclusive of this tax.</li>\r\n<li><code>Tax Type</code>: a required field indicating how tax should be calculated: Percentage, Fixed Amount, None, Balance or Python Code, (the latter is found in the Compute Code field in the Special Computation tab).</li>\r\n<li><code>Amount</code>: a required field whose meaning depends on the Tax Type, being a multiplier of the base amount when the Tax Type is Percentageand a fixed amount added to the base amount when the Tax Type is Fixed Amount.</li>\r\n<li><code>Invoice Tax Account</code>: a General Account used to record invoiced tax amounts, which may be the same for several taxes or split according to percentage so that one tax is allocated to one account.</li>\r\n<li><code>Refund Tax Account</code>: a General Account used to record invoiced tax refunds, which may be the same as the Invoice Tax Account or, in some tax jurisdictions, has to be separated.</li>\r\n<li><code>Tax on Children</code>: when checked, the tax calculation is applied to the output from other tax calculations specified in the Child Tax Accounts field (so you can have taxes on taxes), otherwise the calculation is applied to the base amount of the transaction.</li>\r\n<li><code>Include in base amount</code>: when checked, the tax is added to the base amount and not shown separately, such as Eco taxes.</li>\r\n<li><code>Child Tax Accounts</code>: other taxes that can be used to supply the figure for taxation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can use child taxes when you have a complex tax situation requiring several tax codes to be used.</p>\r\n<p>The fields above apply the taxes that you specify and record them in the general accounts, but do not provide you with the information that your tax authorities might need. Use the <code>Tax Definition</code> tab, parts Tax Declaration: Invoices and Credit Notes to define to which tax codes the tax should be assigned:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Account Base Code</code>: tax code to record the invoiced amount (exclusive of taxes) the tax is calculated on.</li>\r\n<li><code>Account Tax Code</code>: tax code to record the calculated tax amount.</li>\r\n<li><code>Refund Base Code</code>: tax code to record the refund amount (exclusive of taxes) the tax is calculated on.</li>\r\n<li><code>Refund Tax Code</code>: tax code to record the refund tax amount.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When you have created a tax structure consisting of taxe codes and taxes, you can use the taxes in your various business objects so that transactions can be associated with taxes and tax-like charges, such as Eco Taxes (Recupel and Bebat, for instance).</p>\r\n<p>When you are retailing to end users rather than selling to a business, you may want to (or be required to) show tax-inclusive prices on your invoicing documents rather than a tax-exclusive price plus tax.</p>\r\n<p>You can assign multiple taxes to a Product. Assuming you have set up the appropriate taxes, you would use the menu <code>Sales &gt; Products &gt; Products</code> to open and edit a Product definition, then:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Select one or more <code>Sale Taxes</code> for any products that you might sell, which may include a Sales Tax or Output VAT and a Sales Eco Tax.</li>\r\n<li>Select one or more <code>Purchase Taxes</code> for any products that you might purchase, which may include a Purchase Tax or Input VAT and a Purchase Eco Tax.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Generally, when you make a purchase or sales, the taxes assigned to the product are used to calculate the taxes owing or owed.</p>\r\n<p>You can also assign multiple taxes to an account, so that when you transfer money through the account you attract a tax amount. This principle can easily be used when posting purchase invoices for which no products are required.</p>\r\n<p>Taxes on Products and Accounts will usually be national taxes. Odoo is capable of automatically converting national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes through the concept of Fiscal Positions.</p>\r\n<p>Go to the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Taxes &gt; Fiscal Positions</code>. You can use the fiscal positions to automatically convert national taxes to the required intracommunal or export taxes, according to the fiscal position specified for the customer or supplier.</p>\r\n<p>Fiscal positions allow you to make a mapping from national taxes to intracommunal or export taxes, or to map your accounts according to these criteria. You can link fiscal positions to your customers and suppliers to ensure automatic and easy VAT conversion when posting entries.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"journal\">Journals</a></h2>\r\n<p>All your accounting entries need to appear in an accounting journal. So you should create a <code>Sales Journal</code> for customer invoices, a Sales Refund journal for customer credit notes, a Purchase Journal for supplier invoices, a Purchase Refund journal for supplier credit notes and a <code>Bank Journal</code> for bank transactions.</p>\r\n<h3>Configuring a Journal</h3>\r\n<p>To view, edit or create new journals use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals</code>.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_journal_form1.png\" alt=\"account journal form\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Defining an Accounting Journal</code></em></p>\r\n<p>Blue fields are mandatory fields. When you select a journal type, some configuration parameters will be preset. The journal type will tell the system where the journal concerned can be used.</p>\r\n<p>Each journal has a specific way of displaying data. The type of journal determines the journal view, which indicates the fields that need to be visible and are required to enter accounting data in that journal. The view determines both the order of the fields and the properties of each field. For example, the field Statement has to appear when entering data in the bank journal, but not in the other journals.</p>\r\n<p>You can also create your own journal views. However, before creating a new view for a journal, check whether there is nothing similar already defined. You should only create a new view for new types of journals.</p>\r\n<p>You can create a sequence for each journal. This sequence determines the automatic numbering for accounting entries. Several journals can use the same sequence if you want to define one for them all, and if your legislation allows this.</p>\r\n<p>Sequences can also be created from the <code>Settings &gt; Technical &gt; Sequences &amp; Identifiers &gt; Sequences</code>. By default, Odoo has only one sequence in the journal definition. If you need two separate sequences to be kept for the journal, you can install the module account_sequence.</p>\r\n<p>The default credit and debit account allow the software to automatically generate counterpart entries when you are entering data through <code>Journal Items</code>. In some journals, debit and credit accounts are mandatory. For example, in a bank journal you should put an associated bank account, so that you do not have to create counterparts for each transaction manually.</p>\r\n<p>A journal can be marked as being centralised. When you do this, the counterpart entries will not be owned by each entry, but will be global for the given journal and period. You will then have a credit line and a debit line centralized for each entry in one of these journals, meaning that both credit and debit appear on the same line. This option is used when posting opening entries in a situation journal.</p>\r\n<p>A bank journal can automatically be created from the bank account(s) you define for your company. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Accounts &gt; Setup your Bank Accounts</code>. Here you create the bank account or IBAN number of your company\'s bank account(s). Fill in the <code>Bank Name</code>, and when you save the entry, your <code>Bank Journal</code> will automatically be created with the <code>Bank Name</code> and the <code>Account Number</code>. The general ledger account for this bank will also be created for you.</p>\r\n<h3>Controls and Tips for Data Entry</h3>\r\n<p>You can have control on journals in Odoo – controls over the accounts.</p>\r\n<p>To avoid entering account data in wrong accounts, you can put conditions on the general accounts about which journal can use a given account. To do this, you have to list all the accounts or valid account types in the second tab, Entry Controls. If you have not added any accounts there, Odoo applies no restriction on the accounts for that journal. If you list accounts and/or the types of accounts that can be used in a journal, Odoo prevents you from using any account or account type not in that list. This verification step starts from the moment you enter data. You can only select allowed accounts or account types.</p>\r\n<p>This functionality is useful for limiting possible data entry errors by restricting the accounts to be used in a journal.</p>\r\n<h4>Control of Data Entry</h4>\r\n<p>In accounting it is not a good idea to allow a data entry directly from bank account A to bank account B. If you enter a transaction from bank A to bank B, the transaction will be accounted for twice.</p>\r\n<p>To prevent this problem, pass the transaction through intermediate account C. At the time of data entry, the system checks the type of account that is accepted in the bank journal: only accounts that are not of type <code>Bank</code> are accepted.</p>\r\n<p>If your accountant defines this control properly, non-accounting users are prevented from transferring payments from one bank to</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"paymentterm\">Payment Terms</a></h2>\r\n<p>You can define whatever payment terms you need in Odoo. Payment terms determine the due dates for paying an invoice.</p>\r\n<p>To define new payment terms, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Payment Terms</code> and then click Create.</p>\r\n<p>The figure below represents the following payment term: 5000 within 5 days, 50% payment at the last day of current month, Remaining on 15th of next month.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_payment_term.png\" alt=\"account payment term\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Configuring payment terms</code></em></p>\r\n<p>To configure new conditions, start by giving a name to the <code>Payment Term</code> field. Text that you put in the field <code>Description</code> on invoices, is used on invoices, so enter a clear description of the payment terms there.</p>\r\n<p>Then create individual lines for calculating the terms in the section <code>Payment Term</code>.</p>\r\n<p>The Amount to pay field enables you to calculate the amount to pay for each line:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>Percent</code>: the line corresponds to a percentage of the total amount, the factor being given in Value Amount. The number indicated in Value Amount must take a value between 0 and 1.</li>\r\n<li><code>Fixed Amount</code>: this is a fixed value given by the <code>Value Amount</code> box.</li>\r\n<li><code>Balance</code>: indicates the balance remaining after accounting for the other lines.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Think carefully about setting the last line of the calculation to <code>Balance</code>, to avoid rounding errors. The highest sequence number is evaluated last.</p>\r\n<p>The two last fields, <code>Number of Days</code> and <code>Day of the Month</code>, enable the calculation of the delay in payment for each line. The delay Day of the Month can be set to <code>-1</code> , <code>0</code> or any positive number. For example, if today is 20th December 2012, and if you want to set payment terms like this:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><code>5000 within 5 days</code>: set Valuation Fixed Amount, Number of Days 5 and Day of the Month 0. That creates journal entry for date 25th December 2012.</li>\r\n<li><code>50% payment at the last day of current month</code>: set Valuation Percent, Number of Days 0 and Day of the Month -1. That creates journal entry for date 31st December 2012.</li>\r\n<li>Remaining on 15th of next month: set Valuation Balance, Number of Days 0 and Day of the Month 15. That creates journal entry for date 15th January 2013.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can then add payment terms to a Partner through the tab <code>Accounting</code> on the partner form.</p>\r\n<h2><a name=\"analytic\">Putting Analytic Accounts in Place</a></h2>\r\n<p>For the initial setup of good analytic accounts you should:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Set up the chart of accounts.</li>\r\n<li>Create the different journals.</li>\r\n<li>Link the analytic journals to your accounting journals.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Setting up the Chart of Accounts</h3>\r\n<p>Start by choosing the most suitable analytic representation for your company before entering it into Odoo. To create the different analytic accounts, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Analytic Accounting &gt; Analytic Accounts</code> and click the Create button. Note that the data you see when creating an analytic account will depend upon the business applications installed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_analytic_form.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Setting up an Analytic Account</code></em></p>\r\n<p>To create an analytic account, you have to complete the main fields:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <code>Account Name</code>.</li>\r\n<li>The <code>Reference</code>: used as a shortcut for selecting the account.</li>\r\n<li>The <code>Account Type</code>: just like general accounts, the Analytic View type is used for virtual accounts which are used only to create a hierarchical structure and for subtotals, and not to store accounting entries. The Analytic Account type will be used for usual accounts that you only want to use in accounting. If you select Contract or Project, it offers you the possibility to manage the validity and the invoicing options for this account. The special type Template of Project allows you to define a template with default data that you can reuse easily.</li>\r\n<li>The <code>Parent Analytic Account</code>: use this field to define the hierarchy between the accounts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If an analytic account (e.g. a project) is for a limited time, you can define a start and end date here.</p>\r\n<p>The <code>Maximum Time</code> can be used for contracts with a fixed limit of hours to use.</p>\r\n<p>You have several methods available to you in Odoo for automated invoicing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Service companies usually use invoicing from purchase orders, analytic accounts or project management tasks.</li>\r\n<li>Manufacturing and trading companies more often use invoicing from deliveries or customer purchase orders.</li>\r\n<li>For more information about invoicing from projects, we refer to the book (soon to be released) about Project and Services Management.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once you have defined the different analytic accounts, you can view your chart through the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Charts &gt; Chart of Analytic Accounts</code>. You can display analytic accounts for one or more periods or for an entire financial year.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_analytic_chart.png\" alt=\"account analytic chart\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Analytic Chart of Accounts</code></em></p>\r\n<h4>Setting up an Analytic Account</h4>\r\n<p>The setup screen for an analytic account can vary according to the modules installed in your database. For example, you will see information about recharging services only if you have the module <code>hr_timesheet_invoice</code> installed.</p>\r\n<p>Some of these modules add helpful management statistics to the analytic account. The most useful is probably the module <code>account_analytic_analysis</code>, which adds such information as indicators about your margins, invoicing amounts, and latest service dates and invoice dates.</p>\r\n<h3>Creating Journals</h3>\r\n<p>Once the analytic chart has been created for your company, you have to create the different journals. These journals enable you to categorise the different accounting entries by their type, such as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Services.</li>\r\n<li>Expense reimbursements.</li>\r\n<li>Purchases of materials.</li>\r\n<li>Miscellaneous expenditure.</li>\r\n<li>Sales.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>At a minimum, you have to create one analytic journal for Sales and one for Purchases. If you do not create these two, Odoo will not validate invoices linked to an analytic account, because it would not be able to create an analytic accounting entry automatically.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_analytic_journal.png\" alt=\"account analytic journal\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Creating an Analytic Journal</code></em></p>\r\n<p>To define your analytic journals, use the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Analytic Accounting &gt; Analytic Journals</code> then click the Create button.</p>\r\n<p>It is easy to create an analytic journal. Just give it a <code>Journal Name</code>, a <code>Journal Code</code> and a <code>Type</code>. The types available are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sale, for sales to customers and for credit notes.</li>\r\n<li>Purchase, for purchases and expenses.</li>\r\n<li>Cash, for financial entries.</li>\r\n<li>Situation, to adjust accounts when starting an activity, or at the end of the financial year.</li>\r\n<li>General, for all other entries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The analytic journal now has to be linked to your general journals to allow Odoo to post the analytic entries. For example, if you enter an invoice for a customer, Odoo will automatically search for the analytic journal of type Saleslinked to your Sales Journal. Go to <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Journals &gt; Journals</code> and select for instance the Sales journal. In the Analytic Journal select the analytic sales journal.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_general_journal.png\" alt=\"account general journal\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Linking an Analytic Journal to a Journal</code></em></p>\r\n<h3>Working with Analytic Defaults</h3>\r\n<p>You can work with analytic default accounts in Odoo by installing the <code>account_analytic_default</code> module. Notice that this module is also linked with the sale, stock and procurement modules.</p>\r\n<p>The system will automatically select analytic accounts according to the following criteria:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Product.</li>\r\n<li>Partner.</li>\r\n<li>User.</li>\r\n<li>Company.</li>\r\n<li>Date.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can configure these criteria using the menu <code>Accounting &gt; Configuration &gt; Analytic Accounting &gt; Analytic Defaults</code> and clicking the Create button. According to the criteria you define here, the correct analytic account will be proposed when creating an order or an invoice.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images/documents/account_analytic_default.png\" alt=\"account analytic default\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-responsive\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><code>Specify Criteria to Automatically Select Analytic Account</code></em></p>', '1', '27', '2015-08-14 00:12:30', '836', '', '2015-08-14 23:58:32', '836', '0', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2015-08-14 00:12:30', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{\"image_intro\":\"\",\"float_intro\":\"\",\"image_intro_alt\":\"\",\"image_intro_caption\":\"\",\"image_fulltext\":\"\",\"float_fulltext\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_alt\":\"\",\"image_fulltext_caption\":\"\"}', '{\"urla\":false,\"urlatext\":\"\",\"targeta\":\"\",\"urlb\":false,\"urlbtext\":\"\",\"targetb\":\"\",\"urlc\":false,\"urlctext\":\"\",\"targetc\":\"\"}', '{\"show_title\":\"\",\"link_titles\":\"\",\"show_tags\":\"\",\"show_intro\":\"\",\"info_block_position\":\"\",\"show_category\":\"\",\"link_category\":\"\",\"show_parent_category\":\"\",\"link_parent_category\":\"\",\"show_author\":\"\",\"link_author\":\"\",\"show_create_date\":\"\",\"show_modify_date\":\"\",\"show_publish_date\":\"\",\"show_item_navigation\":\"\",\"show_icons\":\"\",\"show_print_icon\":\"\",\"show_email_icon\":\"\",\"show_vote\":\"\",\"show_hits\":\"\",\"show_noauth\":\"\",\"urls_position\":\"\",\"alternative_readmore\":\"\",\"article_layout\":\"\",\"show_publishing_options\":\"\",\"show_article_options\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_backend\":\"\",\"show_urls_images_frontend\":\"\"}', '2', '8', '', 'Accounts have be configured to meet your company\'s needs.
